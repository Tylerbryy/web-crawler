A Clarifai application can be used as a vector database after uploading inputs.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Clarifai vector database. Examples are shown to demonstrate text semantic search capabilities. Clarifai also supports semantic search with images, video frames, and localized search (see Rank) and attribute search (see Filter).\n\nTo use Clarifai, you must have an account and a Personal Access Token (PAT) key. Check here to get or create a PAT.\n\nDependencies\n# Install required dependencies\npip install clarifai\n\nImports\n\nHere we will be setting the personal access token. You can find your PAT under settings/security on the platform.\n\n# Please login and get your API key from  https://clarifai.com/settings/security\nfrom getpass import getpass\n\nCLARIFAI_PAT = getpass()\n\n     ········\n\n# Import the required modules\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Clarifai\n\nSetup\n\nSetup the user id and app id where the text data will be uploaded.

This section will upload each text with its respective metadata to a Clarifai Application. The Clarifai Application can then be used for semantic search to find relevant texts.\n\ntexts = [\n    \"I really enjoy spending time with you\",\n    \"I hate spending time with my dog\",\n    \"I want to go for a run\",\n    \"I went to the movies yesterday\",\n    \"I love playing soccer with my friends\",\n]\n\nmetadatas = [\n    {\"id\": i, \"text\": text, \"source\": \"book 1\", \"category\": [\"books\", \"modern\"]}\n    for i, text in enumerate(texts)\n]\n\nclarifai_vector_db = Clarifai.from_texts(\n    user_id=USER_ID,\n    app_id=APP_ID,\n    texts=texts,\n    pat=CLARIFAI_PAT,\n    number_of_docs=NUMBER_OF_DOCS,\n    metadatas=metadatas,\n)\n\ndocs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search(\"I would love to see you\")\ndocs\n\n    [Document(page_content='I really enjoy spending time with you', metadata={'text': 'I really enjoy spending time with you', 'id': 0.0, 'source': 'book 1', 'category': ['books', 'modern']}),\n     Document(page_content='I went to the movies yesterday', metadata={'text': 'I went to the movies yesterday', 'id': 3.0, 'source': 'book 1', 'category': ['books', 'modern']})]\n\n# There is lots powerful filtering you can do within an app by leveraging metadata filters.\n# This one will limit the similarity query to only the texts that have key of \"source\" matching value of \"book 1\"\nbook1_similar_docs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search(\n    \"I would love to see you\", filter={\"source\": \"book 1\"}\n)\n\n# you can also use lists in the input's metadata and then select things that match an item in the list.

Most users will already have done that before interacting with LangChain so this example will use the data in an existing app to perform searches. Check out our API docs and UI docs. The Clarifai Application can then be used for semantic search to find relevant documents.\n\nUSER_ID = \"USERNAME_ID\"\nAPP_ID = \"APPLICATION_ID\"\nNUMBER_OF_DOCS = 4\n\nclarifai_vector_db = Clarifai(\n    user_id=USER_ID,\n    app_id=APP_ID,\n    pat=CLARIFAI_PAT,\n    number_of_docs=NUMBER_OF_DOCS,\n)\n\ndocs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search(\"Texts related to criminals and violence\")\ndocs\n\nPrevious\nChroma\nNext\nClickHouse"
