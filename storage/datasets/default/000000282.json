These values will be added to the document's metadata. (ObsidianLoader can also be passed a collect_metadata=False argument to disable this behavior.)\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import ObsidianLoader\n\nloader = ObsidianLoader(\"<path-to-obsidian>\")\n\ndocs = loader.load()\n\nPrevious\nNuclia\nNext\nOpen Document Format (ODT)"
