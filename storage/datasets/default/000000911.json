SKLearnVectorStore wraps this implementation and adds the possibility to persist the vector store in json, bson (binary json) or Apache Parquet format.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use the SKLearnVectorStore vector database.\n\n# # if you plan to use bson serialization, install also:\n# %pip install bson\n\n# # if you plan to use parquet serialization, install also:\n%pip install pandas pyarrow\n\n\nTo use OpenAI embeddings, you will need an OpenAI key.
