You can use Hologres to write, update, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real time. Hologres supports standard SQL syntax, is compatible with PostgreSQL, and supports most PostgreSQL functions. Hologres supports online analytical processing (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis for up to petabytes of data, and provides high-concurrency and low-latency online data services.\n\nHologres provides vector database functionality by adopting Proxima. Proxima is a high-performance software library developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy. It allows you to search for the nearest neighbors of vectors. Proxima provides higher stability and performance than similar open-source software such as Faiss. Proxima allows you to search for similar text or image embeddings with high throughput and low latency. Hologres is deeply integrated with Proxima to provide a high-performance vector search service.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Hologres Proxima vector database.

I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you‚Äôre at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n    \n    Tonight, I‚Äôd like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer‚Äîan Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n    \n    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n    \n    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.\n\nPrevious\nHippo\nNext\nLanceDB"
