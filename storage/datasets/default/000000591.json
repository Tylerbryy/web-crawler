However, most user queries are in question format. If we convert documents into Q&A format before vectorizing them, we can increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents, and decrease the likelihood of retrieving irrelevant documents.\n\nWe can accomplish this using the Doctran library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to \"interrogate\" documents.\n\nSee this notebook for benchmarks on vector similarity scores for various queries based on raw documents versus interrogated documents.\n\npip install doctran\n\nimport json\n\nfrom langchain.document_transformers import DoctranQATransformer\nfrom langchain.schema import Document\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()\n\n    True\n\nInput​\n\nThis is the document we'll interrogate\n\nsample_text = \"\"\"[Generated with ChatGPT]\n\nConfidential Document - For Internal Use Only\n\nDate: July 1, 2023\n\nSubject: Updates and Discussions on Various Topics\n\nDear Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.
