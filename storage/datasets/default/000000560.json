The OctoAI compute service helps you run, tune, and scale AI applications.\n\nThis example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with OctoAI LLM endpoints\n\nSetup‚Äã\n\nTo run our example app, there are four simple steps to take:\n\nClone the MPT-7B demo template to your OctoAI account by visiting https://octoai.cloud/templates/mpt-7b-demo then clicking \"Clone Template.\"\n\nIf you want to use a different LLM model, you can also containerize the model and make a custom OctoAI endpoint yourself, by following Build a Container from Python and Create a Custom Endpoint from a Container\n\nPaste your Endpoint URL in the code cell below\n\nGet an API Token from your OctoAI account page.\n\nPaste your API key in in the code cell below\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OCTOAI_API_TOKEN\"] = \"OCTOAI_API_TOKEN\"\nos.environ[\"ENDPOINT_URL\"] = \"https://mpt-7b-demo-f1kzsig6xes9.octoai.run/generate\"\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms.octoai_endpoint import OctoAIEndpoint\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\nExample‚Äã\ntemplate = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task.

He is best known for his masterpieces including Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, and The Virgin of the Rocks. He was a draftsman, sculptor, architect, and one of the most important figures in the history of science. Da Vinci flew gliders, experimented with water turbines and windmills, and invented the catapult and a joystick-type human-powered aircraft control. He may have pioneered helicopters. As a scholar, he was interested in anatomy, geology, botany, engineering, mathematics, and astronomy.\\nOther painters and patrons claimed to be more talented, but Leonardo da Vinci was an incredibly productive artist, sculptor, engineer, anatomist, and scientist.'\n\nPrevious\nNLP Cloud\nNext\nOllama"
