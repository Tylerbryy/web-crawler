If you're building your own machine learning models, Replicate makes it easy to deploy them at scale.\n\nThis example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Replicate models\n\nSetup​\n# magics to auto-reload external modules in case you are making changes to langchain while working on this notebook\n%autoreload 2\n\n\nTo run this notebook, you'll need to create a replicate account and install the replicate python client.\n\npoetry run pip install replicate\n\n    Collecting replicate\n      Using cached replicate-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl (21 kB)\n    Requirement already satisfied: packaging in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from replicate) (23.1)\n    Requirement already satisfied: pydantic>1 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from replicate) (1.10.9)\n    Requirement already satisfied: requests>2 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from replicate) (2.28.2)\n    Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=4.2.0 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from pydantic>1->replicate) (4.5.0)\n    Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from requests>2->replicate) (3.1.0)\n    Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from requests>2->replicate) (3.4)\n    Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from requests>2->replicate) (1.26.16)\n    Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from requests>2->replicate) (2023.5.7)\n    Installing collected packages: replicate\n    Successfully installed replicate-0.9.0\n\n# get a token: https://replicate.com/account\n\nfrom getpass import getpass\n\nREPLICATE_API_TOKEN = getpass()\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"REPLICATE_API_TOKEN\"] = REPLICATE_API_TOKEN\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms import Replicate\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\nCalling a model​\n\nFind a model on the replicate explore page, and then paste in the model name and version in this format: model_name/version.\n\nFor example, here is LLama-V2.\n\nllm = Replicate(\n    model=\"a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat:df7690f1994d94e96ad9d568eac121aecf50684a0b0963b25a41cc40061269e5\",\n    model_kwargs={\"temperature\": 0.75, \"max_length\": 500, \"top_p\": 1},\n)\nprompt = \"\"\"\nUser: Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step. Can a dog drive a car?\nAssistant:\n\"\"\"\nllm(prompt)\n\n    '1. Dogs do not have the ability to operate complex machinery like cars.\\n2. Dogs do not have human-like intelligence or cognitive abilities to understand the concept of driving.\\n3. Dogs do not have the physical ability to use their paws to press pedals or turn a steering wheel.\\n4. Therefore, a dog cannot drive a car.'\n\n\nAs another example, for this dolly model, click on the API tab. The model name/version would be: replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5\n\nOnly the model param is required, but we can add other model params when initializing.\n\nFor example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:\n\nReplicate(model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\", input={'image_dimensions': '512x512'})\n\n\nNote that only the first output of a model will be returned.\n\nllm = Replicate(\n    model=\"replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5\"\n)\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\nAnswer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step. \nCan a dog drive a car?\n\"\"\"\nllm(prompt)\n\n    'No, dogs lack some of the brain functions required to operate a motor vehicle. They cannot focus and react in time to accelerate or brake correctly. Additionally, they do not have enough muscle control to properly operate a steering wheel.\\n\\n'\n\n\nWe can call any replicate model using this syntax. For example, we can call stable diffusion.\n\ntext2image = Replicate(\n    model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\",\n    model_kwargs={\"image_dimensions\": \"512x512\"},\n)\n\nimage_output = text2image(\"A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso\")\nimage_output\n\n    'https://pbxt.replicate.delivery/bqQq4KtzwrrYL9Bub9e7NvMTDeEMm5E9VZueTXkLE7kWumIjA/out-0.png'\n\n\nThe model spits out a URL. Let's render it.\n\npoetry run pip install Pillow\n\n    Requirement already satisfied: Pillow in /Users/bagatur/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (9.5.0)\n    \n    [notice] A new release of pip is available: 23.2 -> 23.2.1\n    [notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip\n\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nresponse = requests.get(image_output)\nimg = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))\n\nimg\n\nStreaming Response​\n\nYou can optionally stream the response as it is produced, which is helpful to show interactivity to users for time-consuming generations. See detailed docs on Streaming for more information.\n\nfrom langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler\n\nllm = Replicate(\n    streaming=True,\n    callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()],\n    model=\"a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat:df7690f1994d94e96ad9d568eac121aecf50684a0b0963b25a41cc40061269e5\",\n    model_kwargs={\"temperature\": 0.75, \"max_length\": 500, \"top_p\": 1},\n)\nprompt = \"\"\"\nUser: Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step. Can a dog drive a car?\nAssistant:\n\"\"\"\n_ = llm(prompt)\n\n    1. Dogs do not have the physical ability to operate a vehicle.\n\nStop Sequences\n\nYou can also specify stop sequences. If you have a definite stop sequence for the generation that you are going to parse with anyway, it is better (cheaper and faster!) to just cancel the generation once one or more stop sequences are reached, rather than letting the model ramble on till the specified max_length. Stop sequences work regardless of whether you are in streaming mode or not, and Replicate only charges you for the generation up until the stop sequence.\n\nimport time\n\nllm = Replicate(\n    model=\"a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat:df7690f1994d94e96ad9d568eac121aecf50684a0b0963b25a41cc40061269e5\",\n    model_kwargs={\"temperature\": 0.01, \"max_length\": 500, \"top_p\": 1},\n)\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\nUser: What is the best way to learn python?\nAssistant:\n\"\"\"\nstart_time = time.perf_counter()\nraw_output = llm(prompt)  # raw output, no stop\nend_time = time.perf_counter()\nprint(f\"Raw output:\\n {raw_output}\")\nprint(f\"Raw output runtime: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n\nstart_time = time.perf_counter()\nstopped_output = llm(prompt, stop=[\"\\n\\n\"])  # stop on double newlines\nend_time = time.perf_counter()\nprint(f\"Stopped output:\\n {stopped_output}\")\nprint(f\"Stopped output runtime: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n\n    Raw output:\n     There are several ways to learn Python, and the best method for you will depend on your learning style and goals. Here are a few suggestions:\n    \n    1.

Here's an example of how do that.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain\n\n\nFirst, let's define the LLM for this model as a flan-5, and text2image as a stable diffusion model.\n\ndolly_llm = Replicate(\n    model=\"replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5\"\n)\ntext2image = Replicate(\n    model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\"\n)\n\n\nFirst prompt in the chain\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\n\nchain = LLMChain(llm=dolly_llm, prompt=prompt)\n\n\nSecond prompt to get the logo for company description\n\nsecond_prompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"company_name\"],\n    template=\"Write a description of a logo for this company: {company_name}\",\n)\nchain_two = LLMChain(llm=dolly_llm, prompt=second_prompt)\n\n\nThird prompt, let's create the image based on the description output from prompt 2\n\nthird_prompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"company_logo_description\"],\n    template=\"{company_logo_description}\",\n)\nchain_three = LLMChain(llm=text2image, prompt=third_prompt)\n\n\nNow let's run it!\n\n# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.\noverall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(\n    chains=[chain, chain_two, chain_three], verbose=True\n)\ncatchphrase = overall_chain.run(\"colorful socks\")\nprint(catchphrase)\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new SimpleSequentialChain chain...\n    Colorful socks could be named after a song by The Beatles or a color (yellow, blue, pink).
