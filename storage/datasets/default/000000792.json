It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.\n\nWhat is Weaviate?\n\nWeaviate is an open-source ‚Äãdatabase of the type ‚Äãvector search engine.\nWeaviate allows you to store JSON documents in a class property-like fashion while attaching machine learning vectors to these documents to represent them in vector space.\nWeaviate can be used stand-alone (aka bring your vectors) or with a variety of modules that can do the vectorization for you and extend the core capabilities.\nWeaviate has a GraphQL-API to access your data easily.\nWe aim to bring your vector search set up to production to query in mere milliseconds (check our open-source benchmarks to see if Weaviate fits your use case).\nGet to know Weaviate in the basics getting started guide in under five minutes.\n\nWeaviate in detail:\n\nWeaviate is a low-latency vector search engine with out-of-the-box support for different media types (text, images, etc.). It offers Semantic Search, Question-Answer Extraction, Classification, Customizable Models (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras), etc. Built from scratch in Go, Weaviate stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering and the fault tolerance of a cloud-native database. It is all accessible through GraphQL, REST, and various client-side programming languages.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\n\nInstall the Python SDK:\n\npip install weaviate-client\n\nVector Store‚Äã\n\nThere exists a wrapper around Weaviate indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for semantic search or example selection.\n\nTo import this vectorstore:\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate\n\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough of the Weaviate wrapper, see this notebook\n\nPrevious\nWeather\nNext\nWhatsApp"
