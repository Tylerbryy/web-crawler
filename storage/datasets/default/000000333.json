The tool is a wrapper for the python-gitlab library.\n\nQuickstart​\nInstall the python-gitlab library\nCreate a Gitlab personal access token\nSet your environmental variables\nPass the tools to your agent with toolkit.get_tools()\n\nEach of these steps will be explained in great detail below.\n\nGet Issues- fetches issues from the repository.\n\nGet Issue- fetches details about a specific issue.\n\nComment on Issue- posts a comment on a specific issue.\n\nCreate Pull Request- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.\n\nCreate File- creates a new file in the repository.\n\nRead File- reads a file from the repository.\n\nUpdate File- updates a file in the repository.\n\nDelete File- deletes a file from the repository.\n\nSetup​\n1. Install the python-gitlab library​\n%pip install python-gitlab\n\n2. Create a Gitlab personal access token​\n\nFollow the instructions here to create a Gitlab personal access token. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions:\n\nread_api\nread_repository\nwrite_repository\n3. Set Environmental Variables​\n\nBefore initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set:\n\nGITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN- The personal access token you created in the last step\nGITLAB_REPOSITORY- The name of the Gitlab repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}.\nGITLAB_BRANCH- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to 'main.'\nGITLAB_BASE_BRANCH- The base branch of your repo, usually either 'main' or 'master.' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to 'main.'\nExample: Simple Agent​\nimport os\n\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.gitlab.toolkit import GitLabToolkit\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.utilities.gitlab import GitLabAPIWrapper\n\n# Set your environment variables using os.environ\nos.environ[\"GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\"] = \"\"\nos.environ[\"GITLAB_REPOSITORY\"] = \"username/repo-name\"\nos.environ[\"GITLAB_BRANCH\"] = \"bot-branch-name\"\nos.environ[\"GITLAB_BASE_BRANCH\"] = \"main\"\n\n# This example also requires an OpenAI API key\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ngitlab = GitLabAPIWrapper()\ntoolkit = GitLabToolkit.from_gitlab_api_wrapper(gitlab)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True\n)\n\nagent.run(\n    \"You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer.
