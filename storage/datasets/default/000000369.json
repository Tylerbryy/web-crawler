We'll go over:\n\nHow to use functions to get structured outputs from ChatOpenAI\nHow to create a generic chain that uses (multiple) functions\nHow to create a chain that actually executes the chosen function\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nfrom langchain.chains.openai_functions import (\n    create_openai_fn_chain,\n    create_openai_fn_runnable,\n    create_structured_output_chain,\n    create_structured_output_runnable,\n)\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n\nGetting structured outputs​\n\nWe can take advantage of OpenAI functions to try and force the model to return a particular kind of structured output. We'll use create_structured_output_runnable to create our chain, which takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as JsonSchema.\n\nUsing Pydantic classes​\n\nWhen passing in Pydantic classes to structure our text, we need to make sure to have a docstring description for the class. It also helps to have descriptions for each of the classes attributes.\n\nfrom langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field\n\n\nclass Person(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Identifying information about a person.\"\"\"\n\n    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The person's name\")\n    age: int = Field(..., description=\"The person's age\")\n    fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"The person's favorite food\")\n\n# If we pass in a model explicitly, we need to make sure it supports the OpenAI function-calling API.\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0)\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\n            \"system\",\n            \"You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats.\",\n        ),\n        (\n            \"human\",\n            \"Use the given format to extract information from the following input: {input}\",\n        ),\n        (\"human\", \"Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format\"),\n    ]\n)\n\nrunnable = create_structured_output_runnable(Person, llm, prompt)\nrunnable.invoke({\"input\": \"Sally is 13\"})\n\n    Person(name='Sally', age=13, fav_food='Unknown')\n\n\nTo extract arbitrarily many structured outputs of a given format, we can just create a wrapper Pydantic class that takes a sequence of the original class.\n\nfrom typing import Sequence\n\n\nclass People(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Identifying information about all people in a text.\"\"\"\n\n    people: Sequence[Person] = Field(..., description=\"The people in the text\")\n\n\nrunnable = create_structured_output_runnable(People, llm, prompt)\nrunnable.invoke(\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Sally is 13, Joey just turned 12 and loves spinach. Caroline is 10 years older than Sally.\"\n    }\n)\n\n    People(people=[Person(name='Sally', age=13, fav_food=''), Person(name='Joey', age=12, fav_food='spinach'), Person(name='Caroline', age=23, fav_food='')])\n\nUsing JsonSchema​\n\nWe can also pass in JsonSchema instead of Pydantic classes to specify the desired structure. When we do this, our chain will output JSON corresponding to the properties described in the JsonSchema, instead of a Pydantic class.\n\njson_schema = {\n    \"title\": \"Person\",\n    \"description\": \"Identifying information about a person.\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\"title\": \"Name\", \"description\": \"The person's name\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"age\": {\"title\": \"Age\", \"description\": \"The person's age\", \"type\": \"integer\"},\n        \"fav_food\": {\n            \"title\": \"Fav Food\",\n            \"description\": \"The person's favorite food\",\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n        },\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"name\", \"age\"],\n}\n\nrunnable = create_structured_output_runnable(json_schema, llm, prompt)\nrunnable.invoke({\"input\": \"Sally is 13\"})\n\n    {'name': 'Sally', 'age': 13}\n\n[Legacy] LLMChain-based approach​\nchain = create_structured_output_chain(Person, llm, prompt, verbose=True)\nchain.run(\"Sally is 13\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new LLMChain chain...\n    Prompt after formatting:\n    System: You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats.\n    Human: Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sally is 13\n    Human: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format\n    \n    > Finished chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Person(name='Sally', age=13, fav_food='Unknown')\n\nCreating a generic OpenAI functions chain​\n\nTo create a generic OpenAI functions chain, we can use the create_openai_fn_runnable method. This is the same as create_structured_output_runnable except that instead of taking a single output schema, it takes a sequence of function definitions.\n\nFunctions can be passed in as:\n\ndicts conforming to OpenAI functions spec,\nPydantic classes, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function they represent and descriptions for each of the parameters,\nPython functions, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function and args, along with type hints.\nUsing Pydantic classes​\nclass RecordPerson(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Record some identifying information about a pe.\"\"\"\n\n    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The person's name\")\n    age: int = Field(..., description=\"The person's age\")\n    fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"The person's favorite food\")\n\n\nclass RecordDog(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Record some identifying information about a dog.\"\"\"\n\n    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The dog's name\")\n    color: str = Field(..., description=\"The dog's color\")\n    fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"The dog's favorite food\")\n\nfrom langchain.chains.openai_functions import (\n    convert_to_openai_function,\n    get_openai_output_parser,\n)\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", \"You are a world class algorithm for recording entities.\"),\n        (\n            \"human\",\n            \"Make calls to the relevant function to record the entities in the following input: {input}\",\n        ),\n        (\"human\", \"Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format\"),\n    ]\n)\n\nopenai_functions = [convert_to_openai_function(f) for f in (RecordPerson, RecordDog)]\nllm_kwargs = {\"functions\": openai_functions}\nif len(openai_functions) == 1:\n    llm_kwargs[\"function_call\"] = {\"name\": openai_functions[0][\"name\"]}\noutput_parser = get_openai_output_parser((RecordPerson, RecordDog))\nrunnable = prompt | llm.bind(**llm_kwargs) | output_parser\n\nrunnable.invoke({\"input\": \"Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken\"})\n\n    RecordDog(name='Harry', color='brown', fav_food='chicken')\n\n\nFor convenience we can use the create_openai_fn_runnable method to help build our Runnable\n\nrunnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt)\nrunnable.invoke({\"input\": \"Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken\"})\n\n    RecordDog(name='Harry', color='brown', fav_food='chicken')\n\nUsing Python functions​\n\nWe can pass in functions as Pydantic classes, directly as OpenAI function dicts, or Python functions. To pass Python function in directly, we'll want to make sure our parameters have type hints, we have a docstring, and we use Google Python style docstrings to describe the parameters.\n\nNOTE: To use Python functions, make sure the function arguments are of primitive types (str, float, int, bool) or that they are Pydantic objects.\n\nclass OptionalFavFood(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Either a food or null.\"\"\"\n\n    food: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Either the name of a food or null. Should be null if the food isn't known.\",\n    )\n\n\ndef record_person(name: str, age: int, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Record some basic identifying information about a person.\n\n    Args:\n        name: The person's name.\n        age: The person's age in years.\n        fav_food: An OptionalFavFood object that either contains the person's favorite food or a null value. Food should be null if it's not known.\n    \"\"\"\n    return f\"Recording person {name} of age {age} with favorite food {fav_food.food}!\"\n\n\nrunnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([record_person], llm, prompt)\nrunnable.invoke(\n    {\n        \"input\": \"The most important thing to remember about Tommy, my 12 year old, is that he'll do anything for apple pie.\"\n    }\n)\n\n    {'name': 'Tommy', 'age': 12, 'fav_food': {'food': 'apple pie'}}\n\n\nIf we pass in multiple Python functions or OpenAI functions, then the returned output will be of the form:\n\n{\"name\": \"<<function_name>>\", \"arguments\": {<<function_arguments>>}}\n\ndef record_dog(name: str, color: str, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Record some basic identifying information about a dog.\n\n    Args:\n        name: The dog's name.\n        color: The dog's color.\n        fav_food: An OptionalFavFood object that either contains the dog's favorite food or a null value. Food should be null if it's not known.\n    \"\"\"\n    return f\"Recording dog {name} of color {color} with favorite food {fav_food}!\"\n\n\nrunnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([record_person, record_dog], llm, prompt)\nrunnable.invoke(\n    {\n        \"input\": \"I can't find my dog Henry anywhere, he's a small brown beagle. Could you send a message about him?\"\n    }\n)\n\n    {'name': 'record_dog',\n     'arguments': {'name': 'Henry', 'color': 'brown', 'fav_food': {'food': None}}}\n\n[Legacy] LLMChain-based approach​\nchain = create_openai_fn_chain([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt, verbose=True)\nchain.run(\"Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new LLMChain chain...\n    Prompt after formatting:\n    System: You are a world class algorithm for recording entities.\n    Human: Make calls to the relevant function to record the entities in the following input: Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken\n    Human: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format\n    \n    > Finished chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n    RecordDog(name='Harry', color='brown', fav_food='chicken')\n\nOther Chains using OpenAI functions​\n\nThere are a number of more specific chains that use OpenAI functions.\n\nExtraction: very similar to structured output chain, intended for information/entity extraction specifically.\nTagging: tag inputs.\nOpenAPI: take an OpenAPI spec and create + execute valid requests against the API, using OpenAI functions under the hood.\nQA with citations: use OpenAI functions ability to extract citations from text.\nPrevious\nAdding memory (state)\nNext\nFoundational"
