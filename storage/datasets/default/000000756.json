It is broken into three parts: installation and setup, LLMs, and Embeddings.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\nInstall the Python SDK with pip install runhouse\nIf you'd like to use on-demand cluster, check your cloud credentials with sky check\nSelf-hosted LLMs‚Äã\n\nFor a basic self-hosted LLM, you can use the SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM class. For more custom LLMs, you can use the SelfHostedPipeline parent class.\n\nfrom langchain.llms import SelfHostedPipeline, SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM\n\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough of the Self-hosted LLMs, see this notebook\n\nSelf-hosted Embeddings‚Äã\n\nThere are several ways to use self-hosted embeddings with LangChain via Runhouse.\n\nFor a basic self-hosted embedding from a Hugging Face Transformers model, you can use the SelfHostedEmbedding class.\n\nfrom langchain.llms import SelfHostedPipeline, SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM\n\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough of the Self-hosted Embeddings, see this notebook\n\nPrevious\nRockset\nNext\nRWKV-4"
