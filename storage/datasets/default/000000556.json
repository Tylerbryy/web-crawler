Obama said the government will provide free flu vaccines to all Americans, ending the government shutdown and allowing businesses to reopen. The president also said that the government will continue to send vaccines to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \"We have lost so much to COVID-19,\" Trump said. \"Time with one another.

Obama says the new guidelines are a \"great step forward\" and that the virus is no longer a threat. He says the government is launching a \"Test to Treat\" initiative that will allow people to get tested at a pharmacy and get antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.
