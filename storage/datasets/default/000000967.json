This makes it perfect for a code sandbox for agents, to allow for safe implementation of things like Code Interpreter\n\nGet your api key here: https://bearly.ai/dashboard/developers\n\nIn this notebook, we will create an example of an agent that uses Bearly to interact with data\n\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.tools import BearlyInterpreterTool\n\n\nInitialize the interpreter\n\nbearly_tool = BearlyInterpreterTool(api_key=\"...\")\n\n\nLet's add some files to the sandbox\n\nbearly_tool.add_file(\n    source_path=\"sample_data/Bristol.pdf\", target_path=\"Bristol.pdf\", description=\"\"\n)\nbearly_tool.add_file(\n    source_path=\"sample_data/US_GDP.csv\", target_path=\"US_GDP.csv\", description=\"\"\n)\n\n\nCreate a Tool object now. This is necessary, because we added the files, and we want the tool description to reflect that\n\ntools = [bearly_tool.as_tool()]\n\ntools[0].name\n\n    'bearly_interpreter'\n\nprint(tools[0].description)\n\n    Evaluates python code in a sandbox environment. The environment resets on every execution. You must send the whole script every time and print your outputs. Script should be pure python code that can be evaluated. It should be in python format NOT markdown. The code should NOT be wrapped in backticks. All python packages including requests, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, pandas, etc are available. If you have any files outputted write them to \"output/\" relative to the execution \n    path. Output can only be read from the directory, stdout, and stdin. Do not use things like plot.show() as it will \n    not work instead write them out `output/` and a link to the file will be returned. print() any output and results so you can capture the output.\n    \n    The following files available in the evaluation environment:\n    - path: `Bristol.pdf` \n     first four lines: [] \n     description: ``\n    - path: `US_GDP.csv` \n     first four lines: ['DATE,GDP\\n', '1947-01-01,243.164\\n', '1947-04-01,245.968\\n', '1947-07-01,249.585\\n'] \n     description: ``\n\n\nInitialize an agent\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    tools,\n    llm,\n    agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,\n    verbose=True,\n    handle_parsing_errors=True,\n)\n\n# Extract pdf content\nagent.run(\"What is the text on page 3 of the pdf?\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    \n    Invoking: `bearly_interpreter` with `{'python_code': \"import PyPDF2\\n\\n# Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\\npdf_file = open('Bristol.pdf', 'rb')\\n\\n# Create a PDF file reader object\\npdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\\n\\n# Get the text from page 3\\npage_obj = pdf_reader.getPage(2)\\npage_text = page_obj.extractText()\\n\\n# Close the PDF file\\npdf_file.close()\\n\\nprint(page_text)\"}`\n    \n    \n    {'stdout': '', 'stderr': 'Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"/tmp/project/main.py\", line 7, in <module>\\n    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PyPDF2/_reader.py\", line 1974, in __init__\\n    deprecation_with_replacement(\"PdfFileReader\", \"PdfReader\", \"3.0.0\")\\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PyPDF2/_utils.py\", line 369, in deprecation_with_replacement\\n    deprecation(DEPR_MSG_HAPPENED.format(old_name, removed_in, new_name))\\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PyPDF2/_utils.py\", line 351, in deprecation\\n    raise DeprecationError(msg)\\nPyPDF2.errors.DeprecationError: PdfFileReader is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0.
