Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs.\n\nAs a very simple example, let's suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input.\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\nphysics_template = \"\"\"You are a very smart physics professor. \\\nYou are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\\nWhen you don't know the answer to a question you admit that you don't know.\n\nHere is a question:\n{input}\"\"\"\nphysics_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(physics_template)\n\nmath_template = \"\"\"You are a very good mathematician. You are great at answering math questions. \\\nYou are so good because you are able to break down hard problems into their component parts, \\\nanswer the component parts, and then put them together to answer the broader question.\n\nHere is a question:\n{input}\"\"\"\nmath_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(math_template)\n\nUsing LCEL​\n\nWe can easily do this using a RunnableBranch. A RunnableBranch is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it's invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input.\n\nIf no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable.\n\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser\nfrom langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch\n\ngeneral_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question as accurately as you can.\\n\\n{input}\"\n)\nprompt_branch = RunnableBranch(\n    (lambda x: x[\"topic\"] == \"math\", math_prompt),\n    (lambda x: x[\"topic\"] == \"physics\", physics_prompt),\n    general_prompt,\n)\n\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nfrom langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import PydanticAttrOutputFunctionsParser\nfrom langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel\nfrom langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function\n\n\nclass TopicClassifier(BaseModel):\n    \"Classify the topic of the user question\"\n\n    topic: Literal[\"math\", \"physics\", \"general\"]\n    \"The topic of the user question. One of 'math', 'physics' or 'general'.\"\n\n\nclassifier_function = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(TopicClassifier)\nllm = ChatOpenAI().bind(\n    functions=[classifier_function], function_call={\"name\": \"TopicClassifier\"}\n)\nparser = PydanticAttrOutputFunctionsParser(\n    pydantic_schema=TopicClassifier, attr_name=\"topic\"\n)\nclassifier_chain = llm | parser\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\nfrom langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser\nfrom langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough\n\nfinal_chain = (\n    RunnablePassthrough.assign(topic=itemgetter(\"input\") | classifier_chain)\n    | prompt_branch\n    | ChatOpenAI()\n    | StrOutputParser()\n)\n\nfinal_chain.invoke(\n    {\n        \"input\": \"What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\"\n    }\n)\n\n    \"Thank you for your kind words! I'll be happy to help you with this math question.\\n\\nTo find the first prime number greater than 40 that satisfies the given condition, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. \\n\\nFirstly, let's list the prime numbers greater than 40:\\n41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, ...\\n\\nNow, we need to check if one plus each of these prime numbers is divisible by 3. We can do this by calculating the remainder when dividing each number by 3.\\n\\nFor 41, (41 + 1) % 3 = 42 % 3 = 0. It is divisible by 3.\\n\\nFor 43, (43 + 1) % 3 = 44 % 3 = 2. It is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nFor 47, (47 + 1) % 3 = 48 % 3 = 0. It is divisible by 3.\\n\\nSince 41 and 47 are both greater than 40 and satisfy the condition, the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 41.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 41.\"\n\n\nFor more on routing with LCEL head here.\n\n[Legacy] RouterChain​\nTHE PREFERRED APPROACH AS OF VERSION 0.0.293 IS TO USE LCEL AS ABOVE.\n\nHere we show how to use the RouterChain paradigm to create a chain that dynamically selects the next chain to use for a given input.\n\nRouter chains are made up of two components:\n\nThe RouterChain itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call)\ndestination_chains: chains that the router chain can route to\n\nIn this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a MultiPromptChain to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChain\nfrom langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\n[Legacy] LLMRouterChain​\n\nThis chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things.\n\nprompt_infos = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"physics\",\n        \"description\": \"Good for answering questions about physics\",\n        \"prompt_template\": physics_template,\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"math\",\n        \"description\": \"Good for answering math questions\",\n        \"prompt_template\": math_template,\n    },\n]\n\nllm = OpenAI()\n\ndestination_chains = {}\nfor p_info in prompt_infos:\n    name = p_info[\"name\"]\n    prompt_template = p_info[\"prompt_template\"]\n    prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[\"input\"])\n    chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n    destination_chains[name] = chain\ndefault_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=\"text\")\n\nfrom langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser\nfrom langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE\n\ndestinations = [f\"{p['name']}: {p['description']}\" for p in prompt_infos]\ndestinations_str = \"\\n\".join(destinations)\nrouter_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str)\nrouter_prompt = PromptTemplate(\n    template=router_template,\n    input_variables=[\"input\"],\n    output_parser=RouterOutputParser(),\n)\nrouter_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt)\n\nchain = MultiPromptChain(\n    router_chain=router_chain,\n    destination_chains=destination_chains,\n    default_chain=default_chain,\n    verbose=True,\n)\n\nprint(chain.run(\"What is black body radiation?\"))\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...\n\n\n    /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain.\n      warnings.warn(\n\n\n    physics: {'input': 'What is black body radiation?'}\n    > Finished chain.\n    \n    \n    Black body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, or emitted by a black body (an idealized physical body which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation).
