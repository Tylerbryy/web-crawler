The Example Selector is the class responsible for doing so.\n\nThe base interface is defined as below:\n\nclass BaseExampleSelector(ABC):\n    \"\"\"Interface for selecting examples to include in prompts.\"\"\"\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def select_examples(self, input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]:\n        \"\"\"Select which examples to use based on the inputs.\"\"\"\n\n\nThe only method it needs to define is a select_examples method. This takes in the input variables and then returns a list of examples. It is up to each specific implementation as to how those examples are selected.\n\nPrevious\nValidate template\nNext\nCustom example selector"
