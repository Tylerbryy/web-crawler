You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately.\n\nFrom source‚Äã\n\nIf you want to install from source, you can do so by cloning the repo and be sure that the directory is PATH/TO/REPO/langchain/libs/langchain running:\n\npip install -e .\n\nLangChain experimental‚Äã\n\nThe langchain-experimental package holds experimental LangChain code, intended for research and experimental uses.

Or pip install \"langserve[client]\" for client code, and pip install \"langserve[server]\" for server code.\n\nLangChain CLI‚Äã\n\nThe LangChain CLI is useful for working with LangChain templates and other LangServe projects.
