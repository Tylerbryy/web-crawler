It provides easy-to-use, cost-effective, high-performance, and easy-to-scale plug-ins that can be applied to various industry scenarios. With over 140 built-in optimization algorithms, Machine Learning Platform for AI provides whole-process AI engineering capabilities including data labeling (PAI-iTAG), model building (PAI-Designer and PAI-DSW), model training (PAI-DLC), compilation optimization, and inference deployment (PAI-EAS). PAI-EAS supports different types of hardware resources, including CPUs and GPUs, and features high throughput and low latency. It allows you to deploy large-scale complex models with a few clicks and perform elastic scale-ins and scale-outs in real time. It also provides a comprehensive O&M and monitoring system.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms.pai_eas_endpoint import PaiEasEndpoint\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntemplate = \"\"\"Question: {question}\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\"\"\"\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[\"question\"])\n\n\nOne who want to use eas llms must set up eas service first.
