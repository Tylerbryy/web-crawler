Users can explore the types of models to deploy in the Model Catalog, which provides Azure Foundation Models and OpenAI Models. Azure Foundation Models include various open-source models and popular Hugging Face models. Users can also import models of their liking into AzureML.\n\nThis notebook goes over how to use a chat model hosted on an AzureML online endpoint\n\nfrom langchain.chat_models.azureml_endpoint import AzureMLChatOnlineEndpoint\n\nSet up‚Äã\n\nTo use the wrapper, you must deploy a model on AzureML and obtain the following parameters:\n\nendpoint_api_key: The API key provided by the endpoint\nendpoint_url: The REST endpoint url provided by the endpoint\nContent Formatter‚Äã\n\nThe content_formatter parameter is a handler class for transforming the request and response of an AzureML endpoint to match with required schema. Since there are a wide range of models in the model catalog, each of which may process data differently from one another, a ContentFormatterBase class is provided to allow users to transform data to their liking. The following content formatters are provided:\n\nLLamaContentFormatter: Formats request and response data for LLaMa2-chat\nfrom langchain.chat_models.azureml_endpoint import LlamaContentFormatter\nfrom langchain.schema import HumanMessage\n\nchat = AzureMLChatOnlineEndpoint(\n    endpoint_url=\"https://<your-endpoint>.<your_region>.inference.ml.azure.com/score\",\n    endpoint_api_key=\"my-api-key\",\n    content_formatter=LlamaContentFormatter,\n)\nresponse = chat(\n    messages=[HumanMessage(content=\"Will the Collatz conjecture ever be solved?\")]\n)\nresponse\n\n    AIMessage(content='  The Collatz Conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, and it has been the subject of much study and research for many years. While it is impossible to predict with certainty whether the conjecture will ever be solved, there are several reasons why it is considered a challenging and important problem:\\n\\n1. Simple yet elusive: The Collatz Conjecture is a deceptively simple statement that has proven to be extraordinarily difficult to prove or disprove. Despite its simplicity, the conjecture has eluded some of the brightest minds in mathematics, and it remains one of the most famous open problems in the field.\\n2. Wide-ranging implications: The Collatz Conjecture has far-reaching implications for many areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. A solution to the conjecture could have significant impacts on these fields and potentially lead to new insights and discoveries.\\n3. Computational evidence: While the conjecture remains unproven, extensive computational evidence supports its validity. In fact, no counterexample to the conjecture has been found for any starting value up to 2^64 (a number', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)\n\nPrevious\nAzure OpenAI\nNext\nBaichuan Chat"
