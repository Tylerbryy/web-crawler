It is currently only implemented for the OpenAI API.\n\nLet's first look at an extremely simple example of tracking token usage for a single Chat model call.\n\nfrom langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4\")\n\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\n    result = llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\n    print(cb)\n\n    Tokens Used: 24\n        Prompt Tokens: 11\n        Completion Tokens: 13\n    Successful Requests: 1\n    Total Cost (USD): $0.0011099999999999999\n\n\nAnything inside the context manager will get tracked. Here's an example of using it to track multiple calls in sequence.\n\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\n    result = llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\n    result2 = llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\n    print(cb.total_tokens)\n\n    48\n\n\nIf a chain or agent with multiple steps in it is used, it will track all those steps.\n\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, verbose=True)\n\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\n    response = agent.run(\n        \"Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\"\n    )\n    print(f\"Total Tokens: {cb.total_tokens}\")\n    print(f\"Prompt Tokens: {cb.prompt_tokens}\")\n    print(f\"Completion Tokens: {cb.completion_tokens}\")\n    print(f\"Total Cost (USD): ${cb.total_cost}\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    \n    Invoking: `Search` with `Olivia Wilde's current boyfriend`\n    \n    \n    ['Things are looking golden for Olivia Wilde, as the actress has jumped back into the dating pool following her split from Harry Styles — read ...', \"“I did not want service to take place at the home of Olivia's current partner because Otis and Daisy might be present,” Sudeikis wrote in his ...\", \"February 2021: Olivia Wilde praises Harry Styles' modesty.
