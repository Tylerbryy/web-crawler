Sources: ../../state_of_the_union.txt\"\n\nMultiple Vectorstores​\n\nWe can also easily use this initialize an agent with multiple vectorstores and use the agent to route between them. To do this. This agent is optimized for routing, so it is a different toolkit and initializer.\n\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import (\n    VectorStoreInfo,\n    VectorStoreRouterToolkit,\n    create_vectorstore_router_agent,\n)\n\nruff_vectorstore_info = VectorStoreInfo(\n    name=\"ruff\",\n    description=\"Information about the Ruff python linting library\",\n    vectorstore=ruff_store,\n)\nrouter_toolkit = VectorStoreRouterToolkit(\n    vectorstores=[vectorstore_info, ruff_vectorstore_info], llm=llm\n)\nagent_executor = create_vectorstore_router_agent(\n    llm=llm, toolkit=router_toolkit, verbose=True\n)\n\nExamples​\nagent_executor.run(\n    \"What did biden say about ketanji brown jackson in the state of the union address?\"\n)\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n     I need to use the state_of_union_address tool to answer this question.\n    Action: state_of_union_address\n    Action Input: What did biden say about ketanji brown jackson\n    Observation:  Biden said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.\n    Thought: I now know the final answer\n    Final Answer: Biden said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.\n    \n    > Finished chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \"Biden said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.\"\n\nagent_executor.run(\"What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks?\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n     I need to find out what tool ruff uses to run over Jupyter Notebooks\n    Action: ruff\n    Action Input: What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks?\n    Observation:  Ruff is integrated into nbQA, a tool for running linters and code formatters over Jupyter Notebooks.
