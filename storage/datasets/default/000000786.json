USearch and FAISS both employ HNSW algorithm, but they differ significantly in their design principles. USearch is compact and broadly compatible with FAISS without sacrificing performance, with a primary focus on user-defined metrics and fewer dependencies.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\n\nWe need to install usearch python package.\n\npip install usearch\n\nVector Store‚Äã\n\nSee a usage example.\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import USearch\n\nPrevious\nUpstash Redis\nNext\nVearch"
