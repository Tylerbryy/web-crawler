You'll need your Account String Identifier (SID) and your Auth Token. You'll also need a number to send messages from.\n\nYou can either pass these in to the TwilioAPIWrapper as named parameters account_sid, auth_token, from_number, or you can set the environment variables TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER.\n\nSending an SMS‚Äã\nfrom langchain.utilities.twilio import TwilioAPIWrapper\n\ntwilio = TwilioAPIWrapper(\n    #     account_sid=\"foo\",\n    #     auth_token=\"bar\",\n    #     from_number=\"baz,\"\n)\n\ntwilio.run(\"hello world\", \"+16162904619\")\n\nSending a WhatsApp Message‚Äã\n\nYou'll need to link your WhatsApp Business Account with Twilio. You'll also need to make sure that the number to send messages from is configured as a WhatsApp Enabled Sender on Twilio and registered with WhatsApp.\n\nfrom langchain.utilities.twilio import TwilioAPIWrapper\n\ntwilio = TwilioAPIWrapper(\n    #     account_sid=\"foo\",\n    #     auth_token=\"bar\",\n    #     from_number=\"whatsapp: baz,\"\n)\n\ntwilio.run(\"hello world\", \"whatsapp: +16162904619\")\n\nPrevious\nTavily Search\nNext\nWikipedia"
