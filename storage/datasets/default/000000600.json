You can apply your MongoDB experience and continue to use your favorite MongoDB drivers, SDKs, and tools by pointing your application to the API for MongoDB vCore account's connection string. Use vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore to seamlessly integrate your AI-based applications with your data that's stored in Azure Cosmos DB.\n\nThis notebook shows you how to leverage the Vector Search capabilities within Azure Cosmos DB for Mongo vCore to store documents in collections, create indicies and perform vector search queries using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms such as COS (cosine distance), L2 (Euclidean distance), and IP (inner product) to locate documents close to the query vectors.\n\nAzure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore provides developers with a fully managed MongoDB-compatible database service for building modern applications with a familiar architecture.\n\nWith Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, developers can enjoy the benefits of native Azure integrations, low total cost of ownership (TCO), and the familiar vCore architecture when migrating existing applications or building new ones.\n\nSign Up for free to get started today.\n\npip install pymongo\n\n    Requirement already satisfied: pymongo in /Users/iekpo/Langchain/langchain-python/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages (4.5.0)\n    Requirement already satisfied: dnspython<3.0.0,>=1.16.0 in /Users/iekpo/Langchain/langchain-python/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pymongo) (2.4.2)\n\nimport os\n\nCONNECTION_STRING = \"AZURE COSMOS DB MONGO vCORE connection string\"\nINDEX_NAME = \"izzy-test-index\"\nNAMESPACE = \"izzy_test_db.izzy_test_collection\"\nDB_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME = NAMESPACE.split(\".\")\n\n\nWe want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we need to set up our Azure OpenAI API Key alongside other environment variables.\n\n# Set up the OpenAI Environment Variables\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure\"\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-05-15\"\nos.environ[\n    \"OPENAI_API_BASE\"\n] = \"YOUR_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT\"  # https://example.openai.azure.com/\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY\"\nos.environ[\n    \"OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT\"\n] = \"smart-agent-embedding-ada\"  # the deployment name for the embedding model\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME\"] = \"text-embedding-ada-002\"  # the model name\n\n\nNow, we need to load the documents into the collection, create the index and then run our queries against the index to retrieve matches.\n\nPlease refer to the documentation if you have questions about certain parameters\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.azure_cosmos_db_vector_search import (\n    AzureCosmosDBVectorSearch,\n    CosmosDBSimilarityType,\n)\n\nSOURCE_FILE_NAME = \"../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\"\n\nloader = TextLoader(SOURCE_FILE_NAME)\ndocuments = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\n# OpenAI Settings\nmodel_deployment = os.getenv(\n    \"OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT\", \"smart-agent-embedding-ada\"\n)\nmodel_name = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME\", \"text-embedding-ada-002\")\n\n\nopenai_embeddings: OpenAIEmbeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(\n    deployment=model_deployment, model=model_name, chunk_size=1\n)\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\nINDEX_NAME = \"izzy-test-index-2\"\nNAMESPACE = \"izzy_test_db.izzy_test_collection\"\nDB_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME = NAMESPACE.split(\".\")\n\nclient: MongoClient = MongoClient(CONNECTION_STRING)\ncollection = client[DB_NAME][COLLECTION_NAME]\n\nmodel_deployment = os.getenv(\n    \"OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT\", \"smart-agent-embedding-ada\"\n)\nmodel_name = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME\", \"text-embedding-ada-002\")\n\nvectorstore = AzureCosmosDBVectorSearch.from_documents(\n    docs,\n    openai_embeddings,\n    collection=collection,\n    index_name=INDEX_NAME,\n)\n\nnum_lists = 100\ndimensions = 1536\nsimilarity_algorithm = CosmosDBSimilarityType.COS\n\nvectorstore.create_index(num_lists, dimensions, similarity_algorithm)\n\n    {'raw': {'defaultShard': {'numIndexesBefore': 2,\n       'numIndexesAfter': 3,\n       'createdCollectionAutomatically': False,\n       'ok': 1}},\n     'ok': 1}\n\n# perform a similarity search between the embedding of the query and the embeddings of the documents\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query)\n\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n    Tonight.
