It is ready for production, served through a REST API.\n\nThis example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with NLP Cloud models.\n\npip install nlpcloud\n\n# get a token: https://docs.nlpcloud.com/#authentication\n\nfrom getpass import getpass\n\nNLPCLOUD_API_KEY = getpass()\n\n     ········\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"NLPCLOUD_API_KEY\"] = NLPCLOUD_API_KEY\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms import NLPCloud\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntemplate = \"\"\"Question: {question}\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\"\"\"\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[\"question\"])\n\nllm = NLPCloud()\n\nllm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)\n\nquestion = \"What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?\"\n\nllm_chain.run(question)\n\n    ' Justin Bieber was born in 1994, so the team that won the Super Bowl that year was the San Francisco 49ers.'\n\nPrevious\nMosaicML\nNext\nOctoAI"
