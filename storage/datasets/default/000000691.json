You can use Hologres to write, update, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real time. Hologres supports standard SQL syntax, is compatible with PostgreSQL, and supports most PostgreSQL functions. Hologres supports online analytical processing (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis for up to petabytes of data, and provides high-concurrency and low-latency online data services.\n\nHologres provides vector database functionality by adopting Proxima. Proxima is a high-performance software library developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy. It allows you to search for the nearest neighbors of vectors. Proxima provides higher stability and performance than similar open-source software such as Faiss. Proxima allows you to search for similar text or image embeddings with high throughput and low latency. Hologres is deeply integrated with Proxima to provide a high-performance vector search service.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\n\nClick here to fast deploy a Hologres cloud instance.\n\npip install psycopg2\n\nVector Store‚Äã\n\nSee a usage example.\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Hologres\n\nPrevious\nHelicone\nNext\nHTML to text"
