The database supports multiple index types and similarity calculation methods. A single index can support a vector scale of up to 1 billion and can support millions of QPS and millisecond-level query latency. Tencent Cloud Vector Database can not only provide an external knowledge base for large models to improve the accuracy of large model responses but can also be widely used in AI fields such as recommendation systems, NLP services, computer vision, and intelligent customer service.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Tencent vector database.\n\nTo run, you should have a Database instance..\n\npip3 install tcvectordb\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings.fake import FakeEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import TencentVectorDB\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.tencentvectordb import ConnectionParams\n\nloader = TextLoader(\"../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\")\ndocuments = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\nembeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=128)\n\nconn_params = ConnectionParams(\n    url=\"http://10.0.X.X\",\n    key=\"eC4bLRy2va******************************\",\n    username=\"root\",\n    timeout=20,\n)\n\nvector_db = TencentVectorDB.from_documents(\n    docs,\n    embeddings,\n    connection_params=conn_params,\n    # drop_old=True,\n)\n\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = vector_db.similarity_search(query)\ndocs[0].page_content\n\nvector_db = TencentVectorDB(embeddings, conn_params)\n\nvector_db.add_texts([\"Ankush went to Princeton\"])\nquery = \"Where did Ankush go to college?\"\ndocs = vector_db.max_marginal_relevance_search(query)\ndocs[0].page_content\n\nPrevious\nTair\nNext\nTigris"
