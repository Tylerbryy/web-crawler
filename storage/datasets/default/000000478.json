We can also set an early stopping method, which will determine our agent's behavior once the number of max iterations is hit. By default, the early stopping uses method force which just returns that constant string. Alternatively, you could specify method generate which then does one FINAL pass through the LLM to generate an output.\n\nmrkl = initialize_agent(\n    tools,\n    llm,\n    agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,\n    verbose=True,\n    max_iterations=2,\n    early_stopping_method=\"generate\",\n)\n\nmrkl.run(\"What is the weather in NYC today, yesterday, and the day before?\")\n\n    [chain/start] [1:chain:AgentExecutor] Entering Chain run with input:\n    {\n      \"input\": \"What is the weather in NYC today, yesterday, and the day before?\"\n    }\n    [llm/start] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 2:llm:ChatOpenAI] Entering LLM run with input:\n    {\n      \"prompts\": [\n        \"System: You are a helpful AI assistant.\\nHuman: What is the weather in NYC today, yesterday, and the day before?\"\n      ]\n    }\n    [llm/end] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 2:llm:ChatOpenAI] [1.27s] Exiting LLM run with output:\n    {\n      \"generations\": [\n        [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"\",\n            \"generation_info\": null,\n            \"message\": {\n              \"lc\": 1,\n              \"type\": \"constructor\",\n              \"id\": [\n                \"langchain\",\n                \"schema\",\n                \"messages\",\n                \"AIMessage\"\n              ],\n              \"kwargs\": {\n                \"content\": \"\",\n                \"additional_kwargs\": {\n                  \"function_call\": {\n                    \"name\": \"Search\",\n                    \"arguments\": \"{\\n  \\\"query\\\": \\\"weather in NYC today\\\"\\n}\"\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      ],\n      \"llm_output\": {\n        \"token_usage\": {\n          \"prompt_tokens\": 79,\n          \"completion_tokens\": 17,\n          \"total_tokens\": 96\n        },\n        \"model_name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"\n      },\n      \"run\": null\n    }\n    [tool/start] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 3:tool:Search] Entering Tool run with input:\n    \"{'query': 'weather in NYC today'}\"\n    [tool/end] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 3:tool:Search] [3.84s] Exiting Tool run with output:\n    \"10:00 am · Feels Like85° · WindSE 4 mph · Humidity78% · UV Index3 of 11 · Cloud Cover81% · Rain Amount0 in ...\"\n    [llm/start] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 4:llm:ChatOpenAI] Entering LLM run with input:\n    {\n      \"prompts\": [\n        \"System: You are a helpful AI assistant.\\nHuman: What is the weather in NYC today, yesterday, and the day before?\\nAI: {'name': 'Search', 'arguments': '{\\\\n  \\\"query\\\": \\\"weather in NYC today\\\"\\\\n}'}\\nFunction: 10:00 am · Feels Like85° · WindSE 4 mph · Humidity78% · UV Index3 of 11 · Cloud Cover81% · Rain Amount0 in ...\"\n      ]\n    }\n    [llm/end] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 4:llm:ChatOpenAI] [1.24s] Exiting LLM run with output:\n    {\n      \"generations\": [\n        [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"\",\n            \"generation_info\": null,\n            \"message\": {\n              \"lc\": 1,\n              \"type\": \"constructor\",\n              \"id\": [\n                \"langchain\",\n                \"schema\",\n                \"messages\",\n                \"AIMessage\"\n              ],\n              \"kwargs\": {\n                \"content\": \"\",\n                \"additional_kwargs\": {\n                  \"function_call\": {\n                    \"name\": \"Search\",\n                    \"arguments\": \"{\\n  \\\"query\\\": \\\"weather in NYC yesterday\\\"\\n}\"\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      ],\n      \"llm_output\": {\n        \"token_usage\": {\n          \"prompt_tokens\": 142,\n          \"completion_tokens\": 17,\n          \"total_tokens\": 159\n        },\n        \"model_name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"\n      },\n      \"run\": null\n    }\n    [tool/start] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 5:tool:Search] Entering Tool run with input:\n    \"{'query': 'weather in NYC yesterday'}\"\n    [tool/end] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 5:tool:Search] [1.15s] Exiting Tool run with output:\n    \"New York Temperature Yesterday.
