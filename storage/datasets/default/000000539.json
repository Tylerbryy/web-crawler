This notebook goes over how to use LangChain with DeepInfra for language models.\n\nSet the Environment API Key‚Äã\n\nMake sure to get your API key from DeepInfra. You have to Login and get a new token.\n\nYou are given a 1 hour free of serverless GPU compute to test different models. (see here) You can print your token with deepctl auth token\n\n# get a new token: https://deepinfra.com/login?from=%2Fdash\n\nfrom getpass import getpass\n\nDEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN = getpass()\n\n     ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN\"] = DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN\n\nCreate the DeepInfra instance‚Äã\n\nYou can also use our open-source deepctl tool to manage your model deployments.
