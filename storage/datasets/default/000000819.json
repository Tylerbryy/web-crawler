By default, most of the agents return a single string. It can often be useful to have an agent return something with more structure.\n\nA good example of this is an agent tasked with doing question-answering over some sources. Let's say we want the agent to respond not only with the answer, but also a list of the sources used. We then want our output to roughly follow the schema below:\n\nclass Response(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Final response to the question being asked\"\"\"\n    answer: str = Field(description = \"The final answer to respond to the user\")\n    sources: List[int] = Field(description=\"List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information\")\n\n\nIn this notebook we will go over an agent that has a retriever tool and responds in the correct format.\n\nCreate the Retriever​\n\nIn this section we will do some setup work to create our retriever over some mock data containing the \"State of the Union\" address. Importantly, we will add a \"page_chunk\" tag to the metadata of each document. This is just some fake data intended to simulate a source field. In practice, this would more likely be the URL or path of a document.\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n\n# Load in document to retrieve over\nloader = TextLoader(\"../../state_of_the_union.txt\")\ndocuments = loader.load()\n\n# Split document into chunks\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ntexts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\n# Here is where we add in the fake source information\nfor i, doc in enumerate(texts):\n    doc.metadata[\"page_chunk\"] = i\n\n# Create our retriever\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\nvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=\"state-of-union\")\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\nCreate the tools​\n\nWe will now create the tools we want to give to the agent. In this case, it is just one - a tool that wraps our retriever.\n\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.conversational_retrieval.tool import (\n    create_retriever_tool,\n)\n\nretriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(\n    retriever,\n    \"state-of-union-retriever\",\n    \"Query a retriever to get information about state of the union address\",\n)\n\nCreate response schema​\n\nHere is where we will define the response schema. In this case, we want the final answer to have two fields: one for the answer, and then another that is a list of sources\n\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\n\nclass Response(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Final response to the question being asked\"\"\"\n\n    answer: str = Field(description=\"The final answer to respond to the user\")\n    sources: List[int] = Field(\n        description=\"List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information\"\n    )\n\nCreate the custom parsing logic​\n\nWe now create some custom parsing logic. How this works is that we will pass the Response schema to the OpenAI LLM via their functions parameter. This is similar to how we pass tools for the agent to use.\n\nWhen the Response function is called by OpenAI, we want to use that as a signal to return to the user. When any other function is called by OpenAI, we treat that as a tool invocation.\n\nTherefore, our parsing logic has the following blocks:\n\nIf no function is called, assume that we should use the response to respond to the user, and therefore return AgentFinish\nIf the Response function is called, respond to the user with the inputs to that function (our structured output), and therefore return AgentFinish\nIf any other function is called, treat that as a tool invocation, and therefore return AgentActionMessageLog\n\nNote that we are using AgentActionMessageLog rather than AgentAction because it lets us attach a log of messages that we can use in the future to pass back into the agent prompt.\n\nimport json\n\nfrom langchain.schema.agent import AgentActionMessageLog, AgentFinish\n\ndef parse(output):\n    # If no function was invoked, return to user\n    if \"function_call\" not in output.additional_kwargs:\n        return AgentFinish(return_values={\"output\": output.content}, log=output.content)\n\n    # Parse out the function call\n    function_call = output.additional_kwargs[\"function_call\"]\n    name = function_call[\"name\"]\n    inputs = json.loads(function_call[\"arguments\"])\n\n    # If the Response function was invoked, return to the user with the function inputs\n    if name == \"Response\":\n        return AgentFinish(return_values=inputs, log=str(function_call))\n    # Otherwise, return an agent action\n    else:\n        return AgentActionMessageLog(\n            tool=name, tool_input=inputs, log=\"\", message_log=[output]\n        )\n\nCreate the Agent​\n\nWe can now put this all together! The components of this agent are:\n\nprompt: a simple prompt with placeholders for the user's question and then the agent_scratchpad (any intermediate steps)\ntools: we can attach the tools and Response format to the LLM as functions\nformat scratchpad: in order to format the agent_scratchpad from intermediate steps, we will use the standard format_to_openai_function_messages. This takes intermediate steps and formats them as AIMessages and FunctionMessages.\noutput parser: we will use our custom parser above to parse the response of the LLM\nAgentExecutor: we will use the standard AgentExecutor to run the loop of agent-tool-agent-tool...\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\nfrom langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder\nfrom langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"),\n        (\"user\", \"{input}\"),\n        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"agent_scratchpad\"),\n    ]\n)\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\n\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind(\n    functions=[\n        # The retriever tool\n        format_tool_to_openai_function(retriever_tool),\n        # Response schema\n        convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Response),\n    ]\n)\n\nagent = (\n    {\n        \"input\": lambda x: x[\"input\"],\n        # Format agent scratchpad from intermediate steps\n        \"agent_scratchpad\": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages(\n            x[\"intermediate_steps\"]\n        ),\n    }\n    | prompt\n    | llm_with_tools\n    | parse\n)\n\nagent_executor = AgentExecutor(tools=[retriever_tool], agent=agent, verbose=True)\n\nRun the agent​\n\nWe can now run the agent! Notice how it responds with a dictionary with two keys: answer and sources\n\nagent_executor.invoke(\n    {\"input\": \"what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson\"},\n    return_only_outputs=True,\n)\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    [Document(page_content='Tonight.
