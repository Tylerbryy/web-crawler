T\n\nhe application retrieves documents using a Retrieval chain to answer questions from your documents.\n\nIt uses the boto3 library to connect with the Bedrock service.\n\nFor more context on building RAG applications with Amazon Kendra, check this page.\n\nEnvironment Setup‚Äã\n\nPlease ensure to setup and configure boto3 to work with your AWS account.\n\nYou can follow the guide here.\n\nYou should also have a Kendra Index set up before using this template.\n\nYou can use this Cloudformation template to create a sample index.\n\nThis includes sample data containing AWS online documentation for Amazon Kendra, Amazon Lex, and Amazon SageMaker. Alternatively, you can use your own Amazon Kendra index if you have indexed your own dataset.\n\nThe following environment variables need to be set:\n\nAWS_DEFAULT_REGION - This should reflect the correct AWS region. Default is us-east-1.\nAWS_PROFILE - This should reflect your AWS profile. Default is default.\nKENDRA_INDEX_ID - This should have the Index ID of the Kendra index. Note that the Index ID is a 36 character alphanumeric value that can be found in the index detail page.\nUsage‚Äã\n\nTo use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:\n\npip install -U langchain-cli\n\n\nTo create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:\n\nlangchain app new my-app --package rag-aws-kendra\n\n\nIf you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:\n\nlangchain app add rag-aws-kendra\n\n\nAnd add the following code to your server.py file:\n\nfrom rag_aws_kendra.chain import chain as rag_aws_kendra_chain\n\nadd_routes(app, rag_aws_kendra_chain, path=\"/rag-aws-kendra\")\n\n\n(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up here. If you don't have access, you can skip this section\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\nexport LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to \"default\"\n\n\nIf you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:\n\nlangchain serve\n\n\nThis will start the FastAPI app with a server running locally at http://localhost:8000\n\nWe can see all templates at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs We can access the playground at http://127.0.0.1:8000/rag-aws-kendra/playground\n\nWe can access the template from code with:\n\nfrom langserve.client import RemoteRunnable\n\nrunnable = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/rag-aws-kendra\")\n\nPrevious\nrag-aws-bedrock\nNext\nrag-chroma-private"
