This changeset utilizes BaseOpenAI for minimal added code.\n\nThis examples goes over how to use LangChain to interact with both OpenAI and HuggingFace. You'll need API keys from both.\n\nSetup‚Äã\n\nInstall dependencies and set API keys.\n\n# Uncomment to install openlm and openai if you haven't already\n\n# !pip install openlm\n# !pip install openai\n\nimport os\nfrom getpass import getpass\n\n# Check if OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set\nif \"OPENAI_API_KEY\" not in os.environ:\n    print(\"Enter your OpenAI API key:\")\n    os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass()\n\n# Check if HF_API_TOKEN environment variable is set\nif \"HF_API_TOKEN\" not in os.environ:\n    print(\"Enter your HuggingFace Hub API key:\")\n    os.environ[\"HF_API_TOKEN\"] = getpass()\n\nUsing LangChain with OpenLM‚Äã\n\nHere we're going to call two models in an LLMChain, text-davinci-003 from OpenAI and gpt2 on HuggingFace.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenLM\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\nquestion = \"What is the capital of France?\"\ntemplate = \"\"\"Question: {question}\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\"\"\"\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[\"question\"])\n\nfor model in [\"text-davinci-003\", \"huggingface.co/gpt2\"]:\n    llm = OpenLM(model=model)\n    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)\n    result = llm_chain.run(question)\n    print(\n        \"\"\"Model: {}\nResult: {}\"\"\".format(model, result)\n    )\n\n    Model: text-davinci-003\n    Result:  France is a country in Europe.

I am not going to lie, this is a complicated issue, and I don't see any solutions to all this, but it is still far more\n\nPrevious\nOpenLLM\nNext\nAliCloud PAI EAS"
