It does this by simultaneously providing a card tokenization/vault service as well as a gateway and receiver integration service. Payment methods tokenized by Spreedly are stored at Spreedly, allowing you to independently store a card and then pass that card to different end points based on your business requirements.\n\nInstallation and Setup​\n\nSee setup instructions.\n\nDocument Loader​\n\nSee a usage example.\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import SpreedlyLoader\n\nPrevious\nspaCy\nNext\nStarRocks"
