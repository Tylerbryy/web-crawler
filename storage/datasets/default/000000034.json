The agent builds off of SQLDatabaseChain and is designed to answer more general questions about a database, as well as recover from errors.\n\nNote that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that the agent won't perform DML statements on your database given certain questions. Be careful running it on sensitive data!\n\nThis uses the example Chinook database. To set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.\n\nInitialization‚Äã\nfrom langchain.agents import create_sql_agent\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType\nfrom langchain.llms.openai import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\")\ntoolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))\n\nUsing ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION‚Äã\n\nThis shows how to initialize the agent using the ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent type.\n\nagent_executor = create_sql_agent(\n    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),\n    toolkit=toolkit,\n    verbose=True,\n    agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n)\n\nUsing OpenAI Functions‚Äã\n\nThis shows how to initialize the agent using the OPENAI_FUNCTIONS agent type. Note that this is an alternative to the above.\n\n# agent_executor = create_sql_agent(\n#     llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"),\n#     toolkit=toolkit,\n#     verbose=True,\n#     agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS\n# )\n\nDisclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è‚Äã\n\nThe query chain may generate insert/update/delete queries. When this is not expected, use a custom prompt or create a SQL users without write permissions.\n\nThe final user might overload your SQL database by asking a simple question such as \"run the biggest query possible\". The generated query might look like:\n\nSELECT * FROM \"public\".\"users\"\n    JOIN \"public\".\"user_permissions\" ON \"public\".\"users\".id = \"public\".\"user_permissions\".user_id\n    JOIN \"public\".\"projects\" ON \"public\".\"users\".id = \"public\".\"projects\".user_id\n    JOIN \"public\".\"events\" ON \"public\".\"projects\".id = \"public\".\"events\".project_id;\n\n\nFor a transactional SQL database, if one of the table above contains millions of rows, the query might cause trouble to other applications using the same database.\n\nMost datawarehouse oriented databases support user-level quota, for limiting resource usage.\n\nExample: describing a table‚Äã\nagent_executor.run(\"Describe the playlisttrack table\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new  chain...\n    \n    Invoking: `list_tables_sql_db` with `{}`\n    \n    \n    Album, Artist, Track, PlaylistTrack, InvoiceLine, sales_table, Playlist, Genre, Employee, Customer, Invoice, MediaType\n    Invoking: `schema_sql_db` with `PlaylistTrack`\n    \n    \n    \n    CREATE TABLE \"PlaylistTrack\" (\n        \"PlaylistId\" INTEGER NOT NULL, \n        \"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL, \n        PRIMARY KEY (\"PlaylistId\", \"TrackId\"), \n        FOREIGN KEY(\"TrackId\") REFERENCES \"Track\" (\"TrackId\"), \n        FOREIGN KEY(\"PlaylistId\") REFERENCES \"Playlist\" (\"PlaylistId\")\n    )\n    \n    /*\n    3 rows from PlaylistTrack table:\n    PlaylistId  TrackId\n    1   3402\n    1   3389\n    1   3390\n    */The `PlaylistTrack` table has two columns: `PlaylistId` and `TrackId`.
