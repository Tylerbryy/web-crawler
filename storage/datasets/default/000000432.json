When you create a search service, you'll work with the following capabilities:\n\nA search engine for full text search over a search index containing user-owned content\nRich indexing, with lexical analysis and optional AI enrichment for content extraction and transformation\nRich query syntax for text search, fuzzy search, autocomplete, geo-search and more\nProgrammability through REST APIs and client libraries in Azure SDKs\nAzure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, and AI (Cognitive Services)\n\nThis notebook shows how to use Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) within LangChain.\n\nSet up Azure Cognitive Search‚Äã\n\nTo set up ACS, please follow the instructions here.\n\nPlease note\n\nthe name of your ACS service,\nthe name of your ACS index,\nyour API key.\n\nYour API key can be either Admin or Query key, but as we only read data it is recommended to use a Query key.\n\nUsing the Azure Cognitive Search Retriever‚Äã\nimport os\n\nfrom langchain.retrievers import AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever\n\n\nSet Service Name, Index Name and API key as environment variables (alternatively, you can pass them as arguments to AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever).\n\nos.environ[\"AZURE_COGNITIVE_SEARCH_SERVICE_NAME\"] = \"<YOUR_ACS_SERVICE_NAME>\"\nos.environ[\"AZURE_COGNITIVE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME\"] = \"<YOUR_ACS_INDEX_NAME>\"\nos.environ[\"AZURE_COGNITIVE_SEARCH_API_KEY\"] = \"<YOUR_API_KEY>\"\n\n\nCreate the Retriever\n\nretriever = AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever(content_key=\"content\", top_k=10)\n\n\nNow you can use retrieve documents from Azure Cognitive Search\n\nretriever.get_relevant_documents(\"what is langchain\")\n\n\nYou can change the number of results returned with the top_k parameter. The default value is None, which returns all results.\n\nPrevious\nArxiv\nNext\nBM25"
