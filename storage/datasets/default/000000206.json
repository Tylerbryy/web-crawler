Use it to limit number of downloaded documents. It takes time to download all 100 documents, so use a small number for experiments.\noptional load_all_available_meta: default=False. By default only the most important fields downloaded: Published (date when document was published/last updated), Title, Authors, Summary. If True, other fields also downloaded.\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import ArxivLoader\n\ndocs = ArxivLoader(query=\"1605.08386\", load_max_docs=2).load()\nlen(docs)\n\ndocs[0].metadata  # meta-information of the Document\n\n    {'Published': '2016-05-26',\n     'Title': 'Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases',\n     'Authors': 'Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch',\n     'Summary': 'Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\\nallowed moves of arbitrary length.
