It is mostly optimized for question answering.\n\nNOTE: this agent calls the Python agent under the hood, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.\n\nPandas examples‚Äã\nimport xorbits.pandas as pd\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain_experimental.agents.agent_toolkits import create_xorbits_agent\n\ndata =
