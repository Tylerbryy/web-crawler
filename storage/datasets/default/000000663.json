It starts with computer vision, which classifies a page into one of 20 possible types. Content is then interpreted by a machine learning model trained to identify the key attributes on a page based on its type. The result is a website transformed into clean-structured data (like JSON or CSV), ready for your application.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\n\nRead instructions how to get the Diffbot API Token.\n\nDocument Loader‚Äã\n\nSee a usage example.\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import DiffbotLoader\n\nPrevious\nDeepSparse\nNext\nDingoDB"
