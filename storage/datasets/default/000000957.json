It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both. It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.\n\nLet's first walk through how to use the utilities.\n\nUsing memory with LLM​\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory\n\nllm = OpenAI()\n\nmemory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"hi\"}, {\"output\": \"whats up\"})\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"not much you\"}, {\"output\": \"not much\"})\n\nmemory.load_memory_variables({})\n\n    {'history': 'System: \\nThe human says \"hi\", and the AI responds with \"whats up\".\\nHuman: not much you\\nAI: not much'}\n\n\nWe can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).\n\nmemory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(\n    llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True\n)\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"hi\"}, {\"output\": \"whats up\"})\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"not much you\"}, {\"output\": \"not much\"})\n\n\nWe can also utilize the predict_new_summary method directly.\n\nmessages = memory.chat_memory.messages\nprevious_summary = \"\"\nmemory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary)\n\n    '\\nThe human and AI state that they are not doing much.'\n\nUsing in a chain​\n\nLet's walk through an example, again setting verbose=True so we can see the prompt.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChain\n\nconversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(\n    llm=llm,\n    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.\n    memory=ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=40),\n    verbose=True,\n)\nconversation_with_summary.predict(input=\"Hi, what's up?\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...\n    Prompt after formatting:\n    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.\n    \n    Current conversation:\n    \n    Human: Hi, what's up?\n    AI:\n    \n    > Finished chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \" Hi there!

Do you have experience with writing documentation?'\n\n# We can see here that there is a summary of the conversation and then some previous interactions\nconversation_with_summary.predict(input=\"For LangChain!
