Go from a prototype built in LangChain or LlamaIndex, or a custom app, to production in minutes without rewriting code.\n\nKey Features:‚Äã\nFast! Zep operates independently of your chat loop, ensuring a snappy user experience.\nChat History Memory, Archival, and Enrichment, populate your prompts with relevant chat history, summaries, named entities, intent data, and more.\nVector Search over Chat History and Documents Automatic embedding of documents, chat histories, and summaries. Use Zep's similarity or native MMR Re-ranked search to find the most relevant.\nManage Users and their Chat Sessions Users and their Chat Sessions are first-class citizens in Zep, allowing you to manage user interactions with your bots or agents easily.\nRecords Retention and Privacy Compliance Comply with corporate and regulatory mandates for records retention while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as CCPA and GDPR. Fulfill Right To Be Forgotten requests with a single API call\n\nNote: The ZepVectorStore works with Documents and is intended to be used as a Retriever. It offers separate functionality to Zep's ZepMemory class, which is designed for persisting, enriching and searching your user's chat history.\n\nInstallation‚Äã\n\nFollow the Zep Quickstart Guide to install and get started with Zep.\n\nYou'll need your Zep API URL and optionally an API key to use the Zep VectorStore. See the Zep docs for more information.\n\nUsage‚Äã\n\nIn the examples below, we're using Zep's auto-embedding feature which automatically embeds documents on the Zep server using low-latency embedding models.\n\nNote‚Äã\nThese examples use Zep's async interfaces. Call sync interfaces by removing the a prefix from the method names.\nIf you pass in an Embeddings instance Zep will use this to embed documents rather than auto-embed them. You must also set your document collection to isAutoEmbedded === false.\nIf you set your collection to isAutoEmbedded === false, you must pass in an Embeddings instance.\nLoad or create a Collection from documents‚Äã\nfrom uuid import uuid4\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import ZepVectorStore\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.zep import CollectionConfig\n\nZEP_API_URL = \"http://localhost:8000\"  # this is the API url of your Zep instance\nZEP_API_KEY = \"<optional_key>\"  # optional API Key for your Zep instance\ncollection_name = f\"babbage{uuid4().hex}\"  # a unique collection name. alphanum only\n\n# Collection config is needed if we're creating a new Zep Collection\nconfig = CollectionConfig(\n    name=collection_name,\n    description=\"<optional description>\",\n    metadata={\"optional_metadata\": \"associated with the collection\"},\n    is_auto_embedded=True,  # we'll have Zep embed our documents using its low-latency embedder\n    embedding_dimensions=1536,  # this should match the model you've configured Zep to use.\n)\n\n# load the document\narticle_url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/71292/pg71292.txt\"\nloader = WebBaseLoader(article_url)\ndocuments = loader.load()\n\n# split it into chunks\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\n# Instantiate the VectorStore.
