It shows how you can allow configurable_alternatives in the Runnable, allowing you to select from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Cohere as your LLM Provider in the playground (or via API).\n\nEnvironment Setup‚Äã\n\nSet the following environment variables to access all 3 configurable alternative model providers:\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY\nCOHERE_API_KEY\nUsage‚Äã\n\nTo use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:\n\npip install -U langchain-cli\n\n\nTo create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:\n\nlangchain app new my-app --package pirate-speak-configurable\n\n\nIf you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:\n\nlangchain app add pirate-speak-configurable\n\n\nAnd add the following code to your server.py file:\n\nfrom pirate_speak_configurable import chain as pirate_speak_configurable_chain\n\nadd_routes(app, pirate_speak_configurable_chain, path=\"/pirate-speak-configurable\")\n\n\n(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up here. If you don't have access, you can skip this section\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\nexport LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to \"default\"\n\n\nIf you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:\n\nlangchain serve\n\n\nThis will start the FastAPI app with a server is running locally at http://localhost:8000\n\nWe can see all templates at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs We can access the playground at http://127.0.0.1:8000/pirate-speak-configurable/playground\n\nWe can access the template from code with:\n\nfrom langserve.client import RemoteRunnable\n\nrunnable = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/pirate-speak-configurable\")\n\nPrevious\npii-protected-chatbot\nNext\npirate-speak"
