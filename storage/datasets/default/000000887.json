It is a great starting point for small datasets, where you may not want to launch a database server.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use functionality related to the DocArrayInMemorySearch.\n\nSetup‚Äã\n\nUncomment the below cells to install docarray and get/set your OpenAI api key if you haven't already done so.\n\n# !pip install \"docarray\"\n\n# Get an OpenAI token: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\n\n# import os\n# from getpass import getpass\n\n# OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()\n\n# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = OPENAI_API_KEY\n\nUsing DocArrayInMemorySearch‚Äã\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearch\n\ndocuments = TextLoader(\"../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\").load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\ndb = DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings)\n\nSimilarity search‚Äã\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\n\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n    Tonight.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n    \n    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n    \n    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.
