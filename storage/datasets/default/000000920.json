FAISS is a widely recognized standard for high-performance vector search engines. USearch and FAISS both employ the same HNSW algorithm, but they differ significantly in their design principles. USearch is compact and broadly compatible without sacrificing performance, with a primary focus on user-defined metrics and fewer dependencies.\n\npip install usearch\n\n\nWe want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.\n\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"OpenAI API Key:\")\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import USearch\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n\nloader = TextLoader(\"../../../extras/modules/state_of_the_union.txt\")\ndocuments = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\ndb = USearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings)\n\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\n\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n    Tonight.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n    \n    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n    \n    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.\n\nSimilarity Search with score‚Äã\n\nThe similarity_search_with_score method allows you to return not only the documents but also the distance score of the query to them. The returned distance score is L2 distance. Therefore, a lower score is better.\n\ndocs_and_scores = db.similarity_search_with_score(query)\n\ndocs_and_scores[0]\n\n    (Document(page_content='Tonight.
