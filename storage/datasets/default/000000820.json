The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vector store and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.\n\nThe recommended method for doing so is to create a RetrievalQA and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set return_direct=True to really just use the agent as a router.\n\nCreate the vector store​\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nrelevant_parts = []\nfor p in Path(\".\").absolute().parts:\n    relevant_parts.append(p)\n    if relevant_parts[-3:] == [\"langchain\", \"docs\", \"modules\"]:\n        break\ndoc_path = str(Path(*relevant_parts) / \"state_of_the_union.txt\")\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n\nloader = TextLoader(doc_path)\ndocuments = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ntexts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\ndocsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=\"state-of-union\")\n\n    Running Chroma using direct local API.\n    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.\n\nstate_of_union = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(\n    llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever()\n)\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/\")\n\ndocs = loader.load()\nruff_texts = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\nruff_db = Chroma.from_documents(ruff_texts, embeddings, collection_name=\"ruff\")\nruff = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(\n    llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=ruff_db.as_retriever()\n)\n\n    Running Chroma using direct local API.\n    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.\n\nCreate the Agent​\n# Import things that are needed generically\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\ntools = [\n    Tool(\n        name=\"State of Union QA System\",\n        func=state_of_union.run,\n        description=\"useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address.

It also re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code quality tools natively, including isort, yesqa, eradicate, and most of the rules implemented in pyupgrade.

You can avoid that and just return the result directly.\n\ntools = [\n    Tool(\n        name=\"State of Union QA System\",\n        func=state_of_union.run,\n        description=\"useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address.
