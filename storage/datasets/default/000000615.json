Aim tracks inputs and outputs of LLMs and tools, as well as actions of agents.\n\nWith Aim, you can easily debug and examine an individual execution:\n\nAdditionally, you have the option to compare multiple executions side by side:\n\nAim is fully open source, learn more about Aim on GitHub.\n\nLet's move forward and see how to enable and configure Aim callback.\n\nTracking LangChain Executions with Aim\n\nIn this notebook we will explore three usage scenarios. To start off, we will install the necessary packages and import certain modules. Subsequently, we will configure two environment variables that can be established either within the Python script or through the terminal.\n\npip install aim\npip install langchain\npip install openai\npip install google-search-results\n\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfrom langchain.callbacks import AimCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\n\nOur examples use a GPT model as the LLM, and OpenAI offers an API for this purpose. You can obtain the key from the following link: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys .\n\nWe will use the SerpApi to retrieve search results from Google. To acquire the SerpApi key, please go to https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key .\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\nos.environ[\"SERPAPI_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\n\n\nThe event methods of AimCallbackHandler accept the LangChain module or agent as input and log at least the prompts and generated results, as well as the serialized version of the LangChain module, to the designated Aim run.\n\nsession_group = datetime.now().strftime(\"%m.%d.%Y_%H.%M.%S\")\naim_callback = AimCallbackHandler(\n    repo=\".\",\n    experiment_name=\"scenario 1: OpenAI LLM\",\n)\n\ncallbacks = [StdOutCallbackHandler(), aim_callback]\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0, callbacks=callbacks)\n\n\nThe flush_tracker function is used to record LangChain assets on Aim. By default, the session is reset rather than being terminated outright.\n\nScenario 1\nIn the first scenario, we will use OpenAI LLM.\n# scenario 1 - LLM\nllm_result = llm.generate([\"Tell me a joke\", \"Tell me a poem\"] * 3)\naim_callback.flush_tracker(\n    langchain_asset=llm,\n    experiment_name=\"scenario 2: Chain with multiple SubChains on multiple generations\",\n)\n\nScenario 2\nScenario two involves chaining with multiple SubChains across multiple generations.\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\n# scenario 2 - Chain\ntemplate = \"\"\"You are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.\nTitle: {title}\nPlaywright: This is a synopsis for the above play:\"\"\"\nprompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"title\"], template=template)\nsynopsis_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, callbacks=callbacks)\n\ntest_prompts = [\n    {\n        \"title\": \"documentary about good video games that push the boundary of game design\"\n    },\n    {\"title\": \"the phenomenon behind the remarkable speed of cheetahs\"},\n    {\"title\": \"the best in class mlops tooling\"},\n]\nsynopsis_chain.apply(test_prompts)\naim_callback.flush_tracker(\n    langchain_asset=synopsis_chain, experiment_name=\"scenario 3: Agent with Tools\"\n)\n\nScenario 3\nThe third scenario involves an agent with tools.\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools\n\n# scenario 3 - Agent with Tools\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm, callbacks=callbacks)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    tools,\n    llm,\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n    callbacks=callbacks,\n)\nagent.run(\n    \"Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend?
