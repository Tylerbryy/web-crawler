A few-shot prompt template can be constructed from either a set of examples, or from an Example Selector object.\n\nUse Case‚Äã\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll configure few-shot examples for self-ask with search.\n\nUsing an example set‚Äã\nCreate the example set‚Äã\n\nTo get started, create a list of few-shot examples. Each example should be a dictionary with the keys being the input variables and the values being the values for those input variables.\n\nfrom langchain.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate\n\nexamples = [\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?\",\n    \"answer\":\n\"\"\"\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.\nFollow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.\nSo the final answer is: Muhammad Ali\n\"\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"When was the founder of craigslist born?\",\n    \"answer\":\n\"\"\"\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?\nIntermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.\nFollow up: When was Craig Newmark born?\nIntermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.\nSo the final answer is: December 6, 1952\n\"\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?\",\n    \"answer\":\n\"\"\"\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?\nIntermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.\nFollow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\nIntermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.\nSo the final answer is: Joseph Ball\n\"\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?\",\n    \"answer\":\n\"\"\"\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: Who is the director of Jaws?\nIntermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.\nFollow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?\nIntermediate Answer: The United States.\nFollow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?\nIntermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.\nFollow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?\nIntermediate Answer: New Zealand.\nSo the final answer is: No\n\"\"\"\n  }\n]\n\nCreate a formatter for the few-shot examples‚Äã\n\nConfigure a formatter that will format the few-shot examples into a string. This formatter should be a PromptTemplate object.\n\nexample_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"question\", \"answer\"], template=\"Question: {question}\\n{answer}\")\n\nprint(example_prompt.format(**examples[0]))\n\n    Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?\n\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?\n    Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.\n    Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?\n    Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.\n    So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali\n\n\nFeed examples and formatter to FewShotPromptTemplate‚Äã\n\nFinally, create a FewShotPromptTemplate object. This object takes in the few-shot examples and the formatter for the few-shot examples.\n\nprompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\n    examples=examples,\n    example_prompt=example_prompt,\n    suffix=\"Question: {input}\",\n    input_variables=[\"input\"]\n)\n\nprint(prompt.format(input=\"Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\"))\n\n    Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?\n\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?\n    Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.\n    Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?\n    Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.\n    So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali\n\n\n    Question: When was the founder of craigslist born?\n\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?\n    Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.\n    Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?\n    Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.\n    So the final answer is: December 6, 1952\n\n\n    Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?\n\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?\n    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.\n    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.\n    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball\n\n\n    Question: Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?\n\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?\n    Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.\n    Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?\n    Intermediate Answer: The United States.\n    Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?\n    Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.\n    Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?\n    Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.\n    So the final answer is: No\n\n\n    Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n\nUsing an example selector‚Äã\nFeed examples into ExampleSelector‚Äã\n\nWe will reuse the example set and the formatter from the previous section. However, instead of feeding the examples directly into the FewShotPromptTemplate object, we will feed them into an ExampleSelector object.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use the SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector class. This class selects few-shot examples based on their similarity to the input. It uses an embedding model to compute the similarity between the input and the few-shot examples, as well as a vector store to perform the nearest neighbor search.\n\nfrom langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\n\nexample_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(\n    # This is the list of examples available to select from.\n    examples,\n    # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.\n    OpenAIEmbeddings(),\n    # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.\n    Chroma,\n    # This is the number of examples to produce.\n    k=1\n)\n\n# Select the most similar example to the input.\nquestion = \"Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\"\nselected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({\"question\": question})\nprint(f\"Examples most similar to the input: {question}\")\nfor example in selected_examples:\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    for k, v in example.items():\n        print(f\"{k}: {v}\")\n\n    Running Chroma using direct local API.\n    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.\n    Examples most similar to the input: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n\n\n    question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?\n    answer:\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?\n    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.\n    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.\n    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball\n\n\nFeed example selector into FewShotPromptTemplate‚Äã\n\nFinally, create a FewShotPromptTemplate object. This object takes in the example selector and the formatter for the few-shot examples.\n\nprompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\n    example_selector=example_selector,\n    example_prompt=example_prompt,\n    suffix=\"Question: {input}\",\n    input_variables=[\"input\"]\n)\n\nprint(prompt.format(input=\"Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\"))\n\n    Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?\n\n    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.\n    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?\n    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.\n    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.\n    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball\n\n\n    Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n\nPrevious\nCustom prompt template\nNext\nFew-shot examples for chat models"
