This loader uses the API to retrieve all notes in the database and their metadata. This requires an access token that can be obtained from the app by following these steps:\n\nOpen the Joplin app. The app must stay open while the documents are being loaded.\nGo to settings / options and select \"Web Clipper\".\nMake sure that the Web Clipper service is enabled.\nUnder \"Advanced Options\", copy the authorization token.\n\nYou may either initialize the loader directly with the access token, or store it in the environment variable JOPLIN_ACCESS_TOKEN.\n\nAn alternative to this approach is to export the Joplin's note database to Markdown files (optionally, with Front Matter metadata) and use a Markdown loader, such as ObsidianLoader, to load them.\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import JoplinLoader\n\nloader = JoplinLoader(access_token=\"<access-token>\")\n\ndocs = loader.load()\n\nPrevious\nIugu\nNext\nJupyter Notebook"
