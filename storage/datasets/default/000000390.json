Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs.\n\n📄️ Sequential\n\nThe next step after calling a language model is to make a series of calls to a language model. This is particularly useful when you want to take the output from one call and use it as the input to another.\n\n📄️ Transformation\n\nOften we want to transform inputs as they are passed from one component to another.\n\nPrevious\nUsing OpenAI functions\nNext\nLLM"
