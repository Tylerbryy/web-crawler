If you don't have access, you can skip this section.\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\nexport LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to \"default\"\n\n\nIf you are inside this directory, you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:\n\nlangchain serve\n\n\nThis will start the FastAPI app with a server running locally at http://localhost:8000\n\nYou can see all templates at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and access the playground at http://127.0.0.1:8000/rag-aws-bedrock/playground.\n\nYou can access the template from code with:\n\nfrom langserve.client import RemoteRunnable\n\nrunnable = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/rag-aws-bedrock\")\n\nPrevious\nrag-astradb\nNext\nrag-aws-kendra"
