Here we show how to pass in the authentication information via the Requests wrapper object.\n\nSince each NLATool exposes a concisee natural language interface to its wrapped API, the top level conversational agent has an easier job incorporating each endpoint to satisfy a user's request.\n\nAdding the Spoonacular endpoints.\n\nGo to the Spoonacular API Console and make a free account.\nClick on Profile and copy your API key below.\nspoonacular_api_key = \"\"  # Copy from the API Console\n\nrequests = Requests(headers={\"x-api-key\": spoonacular_api_key})\nspoonacular_toolkit = NLAToolkit.from_llm_and_url(\n    llm,\n    \"https://spoonacular.com/application/frontend/downloads/spoonacular-openapi-3.json\",\n    requests=requests,\n    max_text_length=1800,  # If you want to truncate the response text\n)\n\n    Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.0 spec.
