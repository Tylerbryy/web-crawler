You can later use the dataset to fine-tune your own LLM models.\nNot only stores embeddings, but also the original data with automatic version control.\nTruly serverless. Doesn't require another service and can be used with major cloud providers (AWS S3, GCS, etc.)\n\nActiveloop Deep Lake supports SelfQuery Retrieval: Activeloop Deep Lake Self Query Retrieval\n\nMore Resources‚Äã\nUltimate Guide to LangChain & Deep Lake: Build ChatGPT to Answer Questions on Your Financial Data\nTwitter the-algorithm codebase analysis with Deep Lake\nCode Understanding\nHere is whitepaper and academic paper for Deep Lake\nHere is a set of additional resources available for review: Deep Lake, Get started and¬†Tutorials\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\nInstall the Python package with pip install deeplake\nWrappers‚Äã\nVectorStore‚Äã\n\nThere exists a wrapper around Deep Lake, a data lake for Deep Learning applications, allowing you to use it as a vector store (for now), whether for semantic search or example selection.\n\nTo import this vectorstore:\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake\n\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough of the Deep Lake wrapper, see this notebook\n\nPrevious\nOpenAI\nNext\nAI21 Labs"
