The tool is a wrapper for the PyGitHub library.\n\nQuickstart​\nInstall the pygithub library\nCreate a Github app\nSet your environmental variables\nPass the tools to your agent with toolkit.get_tools()\n\nEach of these steps will be explained in great detail below.\n\nGet Issues- fetches issues from the repository.\n\nGet Issue- fetches details about a specific issue.\n\nComment on Issue- posts a comment on a specific issue.\n\nCreate Pull Request- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.\n\nCreate File- creates a new file in the repository.\n\nRead File- reads a file from the repository.\n\nUpdate File- updates a file in the repository.\n\nDelete File- deletes a file from the repository.\n\nSetup​\n1. Install the pygithub library​\n%pip install pygithub\n\n2. Create a Github App​\n\nFollow the instructions here to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions:\n\nCommit statuses (read only)\nContents (read and write)\nIssues (read and write)\nMetadata (read only)\nPull requests (read and write)\n\nOnce the app has been registered, add it to the repository you wish the bot to act upon.\n\n3. Set Environmental Variables​\n\nBefore initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set:\n\nGITHUB_APP_ID- A six digit number found in your app's general settings\nGITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY- The location of your app's private key .pem file\nGITHUB_REPOSITORY- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first!\nGITHUB_BRANCH- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to 'master.'\nGITHUB_BASE_BRANCH- The base branch of your repo, usually either 'main' or 'master.' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to 'master.'\nExample: Simple Agent​\nimport os\n\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.github.toolkit import GitHubToolkit\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.utilities.github import GitHubAPIWrapper\n\n# Set your environment variables using os.environ\nos.environ[\"GITHUB_APP_ID\"] = \"123456\"\nos.environ[\"GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY\"] = \"path/to/your/private-key.pem\"\nos.environ[\"GITHUB_REPOSITORY\"] = \"username/repo-name\"\nos.environ[\"GITHUB_BRANCH\"] = \"bot-branch-name\"\nos.environ[\"GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH\"] = \"main\"\n\n# This example also requires an OpenAI API key\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ngithub = GitHubAPIWrapper()\ntoolkit = GitHubToolkit.from_github_api_wrapper(github)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True\n)\n\nagent.run(\n    \"You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer. You are tasked with completing issues on a github repository. Please look at the existing issues and complete them.\"\n)\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n     I need to figure out what issues need to be completed.\n    Action: Get Issues\n    Action Input: N/A\n    Observation: Found 1 issues:\n    [{'title': 'Update README file', 'number': 9}]\n    Thought: I need to get more information about this issue.\n    Action: Get Issue\n    Action Input: 9\n    Observation: {\"title\": \"Update README file\", \"body\": \"Find what the most popular frontend framework is right now and add a short blurb to the readme.md file about how this website will take advantage of it.\", \"comments\": \"[]\"}\n    Thought: I need to update the README file.\n    Action: Create File\n    Action Input: README.md\n    Observation: File already exists at README.md.

For this example, we'll make an agent that does not use the create_file, delete_file or create_pull_request tools, but can also use duckduckgo-search.\n\n%pip install duckduckgo-search\n\nfrom langchain.agents import Tool\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun\n\ntools = []\nunwanted_tools = [\"Get Issue\", \"Delete File\", \"Create File\", \"Create Pull Request\"]\n\nfor tool in toolkit.get_tools():\n    if tool.name not in unwanted_tools:\n        tools.append(tool)\ntools += [\n    Tool(\n        name=\"Search\",\n        func=DuckDuckGoSearchRun().run,\n        description=\"useful for when you need to search the web\",\n    )\n]\n\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    tools=tools,\n    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.1),\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n    verbose=True,\n)\n\n\nFinally let's build a prompt and test it out!\n\n# The GitHubAPIWrapper can be used outside of an agent, too\n# This gets the info about issue number 9, since we want to\n# force the agent to address this specific issue.\n\nissue = github.get_issue(9)\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are a senior frontend developer who is experienced in HTML, CSS, and JS- especially React.\nYou have been assigned the below issue.
