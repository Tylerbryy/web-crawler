A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.\n\nGet started‚Äã\n\nThis walkthrough showcases basic functionality related to vector stores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the text embedding model interfaces before diving into this.\n\nThere are many great vector store options, here are a few that are free, open-source, and run entirely on your local machine. Review all integrations for many great hosted offerings.\n\nChroma\nFAISS\nLance\n\nThis walkthrough uses the chroma vector database, which runs on your local machine as a library.\n\npip install chromadb\n\n\nWe want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.\n\nimport os\nimport getpass\n\nos.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n\n# Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store.\nraw_documents = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt').load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocuments = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)\ndb = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())\n\nSimilarity search‚Äã\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you‚Äôre at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.\n\n    Tonight, I‚Äôd like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer‚Äîan Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.\n\n    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\n    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.\n\nSimilarity search by vector‚Äã\n\nIt is also possible to do a search for documents similar to a given embedding vector using similarity_search_by_vector which accepts an embedding vector as a parameter instead of a string.\n\nembedding_vector = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query(query)\ndocs = db.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding_vector)\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n\nThe query is the same, and so the result is also the same.\n\n    Tonight.

That gives performance benefits as you don't waste time waiting for responses from external services. That might also be important if you work with an asynchronous framework, such as FastAPI.\n\nLangChain supports async operation on vector stores. All the methods might be called using their async counterparts, with the prefix a, meaning async.\n\nQdrant is a vector store, which supports all the async operations, thus it will be used in this walkthrough.\n\npip install qdrant-client\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant\n\nCreate a vector store asynchronously‚Äã\ndb = await Qdrant.afrom_documents(documents, embeddings, \"http://localhost:6333\")\n\nSimilarity search‚Äã\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = await db.asimilarity_search(query)\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n    Tonight.

It is also supported in async API.\n\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\nfound_docs = await qdrant.amax_marginal_relevance_search(query, k=2, fetch_k=10)\nfor i, doc in enumerate(found_docs):\n    print(f\"{i + 1}.\", doc.page_content, \"\\n\")\n\n1.

But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.\n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old.\n\nOfficer Rivera was 22.\n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nI‚Äôve worked on these issues a long time.\n\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who‚Äôll walk the beat, who‚Äôll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nPrevious\nCaching\nNext\nRetrievers"
