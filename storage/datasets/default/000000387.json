The most direct one is by using call:\n\n📄️ Custom chain\n\nTo implement your own custom chain you can subclass Chain and implement the following methods:\n\n📄️ Adding memory (state)\n\nChains can be initialized with a Memory object, which will persist data across calls to the chain. This makes a Chain stateful.\n\n📄️ Using OpenAI functions\n\nThis walkthrough demonstrates how to incorporate OpenAI function-calling API's in a chain. We'll go over:\n\nPrevious\nChains\nNext\nAsync API"
