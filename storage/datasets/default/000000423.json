This gives all LLMs basic support for streaming.\n\nStreaming support defaults to returning an Iterator (or AsyncIterator in the case of async streaming) of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying LLM provider. This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the LLM provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our LLM integrations.\n\nSee which integrations support token-by-token streaming here.\n\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0, max_tokens=512)\nfor chunk in llm.stream(\"Write me a song about sparkling water.\"):\n    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n\n    \n    \n    Verse 1:\n    Bubbles dancing in my glass\n    Clear and crisp, it's such a blast\n    Refreshing taste, it's like a dream\n    Sparkling water, you make me beam\n    \n    Chorus:\n    Oh sparkling water, you're my delight\n    With every sip, you make me feel so right\n    You're like a party in my mouth\n    I can't get enough, I'm hooked no doubt\n    \n    Verse 2:\n    No sugar, no calories, just pure bliss\n    You're the perfect drink, I must confess\n    From lemon to lime, so many flavors to choose\n    Sparkling water, you never fail to amuse\n    \n    Chorus:\n    Oh sparkling water, you're my delight\n    With every sip, you make me feel so right\n    You're like a party in my mouth\n    I can't get enough, I'm hooked no doubt\n    \n    Bridge:\n    Some may say you're just plain water\n    But to me, you're so much more\n    You bring a sparkle to my day\n    In every single way\n    \n    Chorus:\n    Oh sparkling water, you're my delight\n    With every sip, you make me feel so right\n    You're like a party in my mouth\n    I can't get enough, I'm hooked no doubt\n    \n    Outro:\n    So here's to you, my dear sparkling water\n    You'll always be my go-to drink forever\n    With your effervescence and refreshing taste\n    You'll always have a special place.\n\nPrevious\nSerialization\nNext\nTracking token usage"
