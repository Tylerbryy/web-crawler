It stores vectors on disk in hnswlib, and stores all other data in SQLite.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use functionality related to the DocArrayHnswSearch.\n\nSetup‚Äã\n\nUncomment the below cells to install docarray and get/set your OpenAI api key if you haven't already done so.\n\n# !pip install \"docarray[hnswlib]\"\n\n# Get an OpenAI token: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\n\n# import os\n# from getpass import getpass\n\n# OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()\n\n# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = OPENAI_API_KEY\n\nUsing DocArrayHnswSearch‚Äã\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import DocArrayHnswSearch\n\ndocuments = TextLoader(\"../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\").load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\ndb = DocArrayHnswSearch.from_documents(\n    docs, embeddings, work_dir=\"hnswlib_store/\", n_dim=1536\n)\n\nSimilarity search‚Äã\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\n\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\n\n    Tonight.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n    \n    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n    \n    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.
