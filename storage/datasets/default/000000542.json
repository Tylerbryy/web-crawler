Peyton Manning? Aaron Rodgers? Or maybe even Andrew Luck?\n    \n    Well, let's look at some stats to decide.\n    \n    First, let's talk about touchdowns. Who's thrown the most touchdowns this season?\n    \n    (pause for dramatic effect)\n    \n    It's... Aaron Rodgers! With 28 touchdowns, he's leading the league in that category.\n    \n    But what about interceptions? Who's thrown the fewest picks?\n    \n    (drumroll)\n    \n    It's... Tom Brady! With only 4 interceptions, he's got the fewest picks in the league.\n    \n    Now, let's talk about passer rating. Who's got the highest passer rating this season?\n    \n    (pause for suspense)\n    \n    It's... Peyton Manning! With a rating of 114.2, he's been lights out this season.\n    \n    But what about wins? Who's got the most wins this season?\n    \n    (drumroll)\n    \n    It's... Andrew Luck! With 8 wins, he's got the most victories this season.\n    \n    So, there you have it folks. According to these stats, the best quarterback in the NFL this season is... (drumroll) Aaron Rodgers!\n    \n    But wait, there's more! Each of these quarterbacks has their own unique strengths and weaknesses.\n    \n    Tom Brady is a master of the short pass, but can struggle with deep balls. Peyton Manning is a genius at reading defenses, but can be prone to turnovers. Aaron Rodgers has a cannon for an arm, but can be inconsistent at times. Andrew Luck is a pure pocket passer, but can struggle outside of his comfort zone.\n    \n    So, who's the best quarterback in the NFL? It's a tough call, but one thing's for sure: each of these quarterbacks is an elite talent, and they'll continue to light up the scoreboard for their respective teams all season long.\n\n# Calling multiple prompts\noutput = llm.generate(\n    [\n        \"Who's the best cricket player in 2016?\",\n        \"Who's the best basketball player in the league?\",\n    ]\n)\nprint(output.generations)\n\n    [[Generation(text='\\nasked Dec 28, 2016 in Sports by anonymous\\nWho is the best cricket player in 2016?\\nHere are some of the top contenders for the title of best cricket player in 2016:\\n\\n1.
