We recommend using multiple evaluation techniques appropriate to your use case. One way to evaluate an agent is to look at the whole trajectory of actions taken along with their responses.\n\nEvaluators that do this can implement the AgentTrajectoryEvaluator interface. This walkthrough will show how to use the trajectory evaluator to grade an OpenAI functions agent.\n\nFor more information, check out the reference docs for the TrajectoryEvalChain for more info.\n\nfrom langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator\n\nevaluator = load_evaluator(\"trajectory\")\n\nMethods​\n\nThe Agent Trajectory Evaluators are used with the evaluate_agent_trajectory (and async aevaluate_agent_trajectory) methods, which accept:\n\ninput (str) – The input to the agent.\nprediction (str) – The final predicted response.\nagent_trajectory (List[Tuple[AgentAction, str]]) – The intermediate steps forming the agent trajectory\n\nThey return a dictionary with the following values:\n\nscore: Float from 0 to 1, where 1 would mean \"most effective\" and 0 would mean \"least effective\"\nreasoning: String \"chain of thought reasoning\" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score\nCapturing Trajectory​\n\nThe easiest way to return an agent's trajectory (without using tracing callbacks like those in LangSmith) for evaluation is to initialize the agent with return_intermediate_steps=True.\n\nBelow, create an example agent we will call to evaluate.\n\nimport subprocess\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\nfrom pydantic import HttpUrl\n\n\n@tool\ndef ping(url: HttpUrl, return_error: bool) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Ping the fully specified url. Must include https:// in the url.\"\"\"\n    hostname = urlparse(str(url)).netloc\n    completed_process = subprocess.run(\n        [\"ping\", \"-c\", \"1\", hostname], capture_output=True, text=True\n    )\n    output = completed_process.stdout\n    if return_error and completed_process.returncode != 0:\n        return completed_process.stderr\n    return output\n\n\n@tool\ndef trace_route(url: HttpUrl, return_error: bool) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Trace the route to the specified url. Must include https:// in the url.\"\"\"\n    hostname = urlparse(str(url)).netloc\n    completed_process = subprocess.run(\n        [\"traceroute\", hostname], capture_output=True, text=True\n    )\n    output = completed_process.stdout\n    if return_error and completed_process.returncode != 0:\n        return completed_process.stderr\n    return output\n\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\", temperature=0)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    llm=llm,\n    tools=[ping, trace_route],\n    agent=AgentType.OPENAI_MULTI_FUNCTIONS,\n    return_intermediate_steps=True,  # IMPORTANT!\n)\n\nresult = agent(\"What's the latency like for https://langchain.com?\")\n\nEvaluate Trajectory​\n\nPass the input, trajectory, and pass to the evaluate_agent_trajectory method.\n\nevaluation_result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory(\n    prediction=result[\"output\"],\n    input=result[\"input\"],\n    agent_trajectory=result[\"intermediate_steps\"],\n)\nevaluation_result\n\n    {'score': 1.0,\n     'reasoning': \"i. The final answer is helpful. It directly answers the user's question about the latency for the website https://langchain.com.\\n\\nii. The AI language model uses a logical sequence of tools to answer the question. It uses the 'ping' tool to measure the latency of the website, which is the correct tool for this task.\\n\\niii. The AI language model uses the tool in a helpful way. It inputs the URL into the 'ping' tool and correctly interprets the output to provide the latency in milliseconds.\\n\\niv. The AI language model does not use too many steps to answer the question. It only uses one step, which is appropriate for this type of question.\\n\\nv. The appropriate tool is used to answer the question. The 'ping' tool is the correct tool to measure website latency.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, the AI language model's performance is excellent. It uses the correct tool, interprets the output correctly, and provides a helpful and direct answer to the user's question.\"}\n\nConfiguring the Evaluation LLM​\n\nIf you don't select an LLM to use for evaluation, the load_evaluator function will use gpt-4 to power the evaluation chain. You can select any chat model for the agent trajectory evaluator as below.\n\n# %pip install anthropic\n# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<YOUR ANTHROPIC API KEY>\n\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic\n\neval_llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0)\nevaluator = load_evaluator(\"trajectory\", llm=eval_llm)\n\nevaluation_result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory(\n    prediction=result[\"output\"],\n    input=result[\"input\"],\n    agent_trajectory=result[\"intermediate_steps\"],\n)\nevaluation_result\n\n    {'score': 1.0,\n     'reasoning': \"Here is my detailed evaluation of the AI's response:\\n\\ni. The final answer is helpful, as it directly provides the latency measurement for the requested website.\\n\\nii. The sequence of using the ping tool to measure latency is logical for this question.\\n\\niii. The ping tool is used in a helpful way, with the website URL provided as input and the output latency measurement extracted.\\n\\niv.

You can provide these to the evaluator via the agent_tools argument.\n\nfrom langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator\n\nevaluator = load_evaluator(\"trajectory\", agent_tools=[ping, trace_route])\n\nevaluation_result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory(\n    prediction=result[\"output\"],\n    input=result[\"input\"],\n    agent_trajectory=result[\"intermediate_steps\"],\n)\nevaluation_result\n\n    {'score': 1.0,\n     'reasoning': \"i.
