You can think of it like Plaid for unstructured data.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\npip install psychicapi\n\n\nPsychic is easy to set up - you import the react library and configure it with your Sidekick API key, which you get from the Psychic dashboard. When you connect the applications, you\nview these connections from the dashboard and retrieve data using the server-side libraries.\n\nCreate an account in the dashboard.\nUse the react library to add the Psychic link modal to your frontend react app. You will use this to connect the SaaS apps.\nOnce you have created a connection, you can use the PsychicLoader by following the example notebook\nAdvantages vs Other Document Loaders‚Äã\nUniversal API: Instead of building OAuth flows and learning the APIs for every SaaS app, you integrate Psychic once and leverage our universal API to retrieve data.\nData Syncs: Data in your customers' SaaS apps can get stale fast. With Psychic you can configure webhooks to keep your documents up to date on a daily or realtime basis.\nSimplified OAuth: Psychic handles OAuth end-to-end so that you don't have to spend time creating OAuth clients for each integration, keeping access tokens fresh, and handling OAuth redirect logic.\nPrevious\nSemaDB\nNext\nPubMed"
