Before feeding the LLM with this data, we need to protect it so that it doesn't go to an external API (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic). Then, after receiving the model output, we would like the data to be restored to its original form. Below you can observe an example flow of this QA system:\n\nIn the following notebook, we will not go into the details of how the anonymizer works. If you are interested, please visit this part of the documentation.\n\nQuickstart‚Äã\nIterative process of upgrading the anonymizer‚Äã\n# Install necessary packages\n# !pip install langchain langchain-experimental openai presidio-analyzer presidio-anonymizer spacy Faker faiss-cpu tiktoken\n# ! python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg\n\ndocument_content = \"\"\"Date: October 19, 2021\n Witness: John Doe\n Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet\n\n Testimony Content:\n\n Hello Officer,\n\n My name is John Doe and on October 19, 2021, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of Kilmarnock during a bike trip. This wallet contains some very important things to me.\n\n Firstly, the wallet contains my credit card with number 4111 1111 1111 1111, which is registered under my name and linked to my bank account, PL61109010140000071219812874.\n\n Additionally, the wallet had a driver's license - DL No: 999000680 issued to my name. It also houses my Social Security Number, 602-76-4532. \n\n What's more, I had my polish identity card there, with the number ABC123456.\n\n I would like this data to be secured and protected in all possible ways. I believe It was stolen at 9:30 AM.\n\n In case any information arises regarding my wallet, please reach out to me on my phone number, 999-888-7777, or through my personal email, johndoe@example.com.\n\n Please consider this information to be highly confidential and respect my privacy. \n\n The bank has been informed about the stolen credit card and necessary actions have been taken from their end. They will be reachable at their official email, support@bankname.com.\n My representative there is Victoria Cherry (her business phone: 987-654-3210).\n\n Thank you for your assistance,\n\n John Doe\"\"\"\n\nfrom langchain.schema import Document\n\ndocuments = [Document(page_content=document_content)]\n\n\nWe only have one document, so before we move on to creating a QA system, let's focus on its content to begin with.\n\nYou may observe that the text contains many different PII values, some types occur repeatedly (names, phone numbers, emails), and some specific PIIs are repeated (John Doe).\n\n# Util function for coloring the PII markers\n# NOTE: It will not be visible on documentation page, only in the notebook\nimport re\n\n\ndef print_colored_pii(string):\n    colored_string = re.sub(\n        r\"(<[^>]*>)\", lambda m: \"\\033[31m\" + m.group(1) + \"\\033[0m\", string\n    )\n    print(colored_string)\n\n\nLet's proceed and try to anonymize the text with the default settings. For now, we don't replace the data with synthetic, we just mark it with markers (e.g. <PERSON>), so we set add_default_faker_operators=False:\n\nfrom langchain_experimental.data_anonymizer import PresidioReversibleAnonymizer\n\nanonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer(\n    add_default_faker_operators=False,\n)\n\nprint_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))\n\n    Date: <DATE_TIME>\n    Witness: <PERSON>\n    Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet\n    \n    Testimony Content:\n    \n    Hello Officer,\n    \n    My name is <PERSON> and on <DATE_TIME>, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of <LOCATION> during a bike trip. This wallet contains some very important things to me.\n    \n    Firstly, the wallet contains my credit card with number <CREDIT_CARD>, which is registered under my name and linked to my bank account, <IBAN_CODE>.\n    \n    Additionally, the wallet had a driver's license - DL No: <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> issued to my name. It also houses my Social Security Number, <US_SSN>. \n    \n    What's more, I had my polish identity card there, with the number ABC123456.\n    \n    I would like this data to be secured and protected in all possible ways. I believe It was stolen at <DATE_TIME_2>.\n    \n    In case any information arises regarding my wallet, please reach out to me on my phone number, <PHONE_NUMBER>, or through my personal email, <EMAIL_ADDRESS>.\n    \n    Please consider this information to be highly confidential and respect my privacy. \n    \n    The bank has been informed about the stolen credit card and necessary actions have been taken from their end. They will be reachable at their official email, <EMAIL_ADDRESS_2>.\n    My representative there is <PERSON_2> (her business phone: <UK_NHS>).\n    \n    Thank you for your assistance,\n    \n    <PERSON>\n\n\nLet's also look at the mapping between original and anonymized values:\n\nimport pprint\n\npprint.pprint(anonymizer.deanonymizer_mapping)\n\n    {'CREDIT_CARD': {'<CREDIT_CARD>': '4111 1111 1111 1111'},\n     'DATE_TIME': {'<DATE_TIME>': 'October 19, 2021', '<DATE_TIME_2>': '9:30 AM'},\n     'EMAIL_ADDRESS': {'<EMAIL_ADDRESS>': 'johndoe@example.com',\n                       '<EMAIL_ADDRESS_2>': 'support@bankname.com'},\n     'IBAN_CODE': {'<IBAN_CODE>': 'PL61109010140000071219812874'},\n     'LOCATION': {'<LOCATION>': 'Kilmarnock'},\n     'PERSON': {'<PERSON>': 'John Doe', '<PERSON_2>': 'Victoria Cherry'},\n     'PHONE_NUMBER': {'<PHONE_NUMBER>': '999-888-7777'},\n     'UK_NHS': {'<UK_NHS>': '987-654-3210'},\n     'US_DRIVER_LICENSE': {'<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>': '999000680'},\n     'US_SSN': {'<US_SSN>': '602-76-4532'}}\n\n\nIn general, the anonymizer works pretty well, but I can observe two things to improve here:\n\nDatetime redundancy - we have two different entities recognized as DATE_TIME, but they contain different type of information. The first one is a date (October 19, 2021), the second one is a time (9:30 AM). We can improve this by adding a new recognizer to the anonymizer, which will treat time separately from the date.\nPolish ID - polish ID has unique pattern, which is not by default part of anonymizer recognizers. The value ABC123456 is not anonymized.\n\nThe solution is simple: we need to add a new recognizers to the anonymizer. You can read more about it in presidio documentation.\n\nLet's add new recognizers:\n\n# Define the regex pattern in a Presidio `Pattern` object:\nfrom presidio_analyzer import Pattern, PatternRecognizer\n\npolish_id_pattern = Pattern(\n    name=\"polish_id_pattern\",\n    regex=\"[A-Z]{3}\\d{6}\",\n    score=1,\n)\ntime_pattern = Pattern(\n    name=\"time_pattern\",\n    regex=\"(1[0-2]|0?[1-9]):[0-5][0-9] (AM|PM)\",\n    score=1,\n)\n\n# Define the recognizer with one or more patterns\npolish_id_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(\n    supported_entity=\"POLISH_ID\", patterns=[polish_id_pattern]\n)\ntime_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(supported_entity=\"TIME\", patterns=[time_pattern])\n\n\nAnd now, we're adding recognizers to our anonymizer:\n\nanonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer)\nanonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer)\n\n\nNote that our anonymization instance remembers previously detected and anonymized values, including those that were not detected correctly (e.g., \"9:30 AM\" taken as DATE_TIME). So it's worth removing this value, or resetting the entire mapping now that our recognizers have been updated:\n\nanonymizer.reset_deanonymizer_mapping()\n\n\nLet's anonymize the text and see the results:\n\nprint_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))\n\n    Date: <DATE_TIME>\n    Witness: <PERSON>\n    Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet\n    \n    Testimony Content:\n    \n    Hello Officer,\n    \n    My name is <PERSON> and on <DATE_TIME>, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of <LOCATION> during a bike trip. This wallet contains some very important things to me.\n    \n    Firstly, the wallet contains my credit card with number <CREDIT_CARD>, which is registered under my name and linked to my bank account, <IBAN_CODE>.\n    \n    Additionally, the wallet had a driver's license - DL No: <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> issued to my name.

The anonymizer has replaced the time and Polish ID entities with the <TIME> and <POLISH_ID> markers, and the deanonymizer mapping has been updated accordingly.\n\nNow, when all PII values are detected correctly, we can proceed to the next step, which is replacing the original values with synthetic ones. To do this, we need to set add_default_faker_operators=True (or just remove this parameter, because it's set to True by default):\n\nanonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer(\n    add_default_faker_operators=True,\n    # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes\n    # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None)\n    faker_seed=42,\n)\n\nanonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer)\nanonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer)\n\nprint_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))\n\n    Date: 1986-04-18\n    Witness: Brian Cox DVM\n    Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet\n    \n    Testimony Content:\n    \n    Hello Officer,\n    \n    My name is Brian Cox DVM and on 1986-04-18, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of New Rita during a bike trip.
