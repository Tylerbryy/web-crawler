SKLearnVectorStore wraps this implementation and adds the possibility to persist the vector store in json, bson (binary json) or Apache Parquet format.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\nInstall the Python package with pip install scikit-learn\nVector Store‚Äã\n\nSKLearnVectorStore provides a simple wrapper around the nearest neighbor implementation in the scikit-learn package, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore.\n\nTo import this vectorstore:\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import SKLearnVectorStore\n\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough of the SKLearnVectorStore wrapper, see this notebook.\n\nPrevious\nSingleStoreDB\nNext\nSlack"
