Get your API key and set it as an environment variable (REPLICATE_API_TOKEN)\nInstall the Replicate python client with pip install replicate\nCalling a model‚Äã\n\nFind a model on the Replicate explore page, and then paste in the model name and version in this format: owner-name/model-name:version\n\nFor example, for this dolly model, click on the API tab. The model name/version would be: \"replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5\"\n\nOnly the model param is required, but any other model parameters can also be passed in with the format input={model_param: value, ...}\n\nFor example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:\n\nReplicate(model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\", input={'image_dimensions': '512x512'})\n\n\nNote that only the first output of a model will be returned. From here, we can initialize our model:\n\nllm = Replicate(model=\"replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5\")\n\n\nAnd run it:\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\nAnswer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step.\nCan a dog drive a car?\n\"\"\"\nllm(prompt)\n\n\nWe can call any Replicate model (not just LLMs) using this syntax. For example, we can call Stable Diffusion:\n\ntext2image = Replicate(model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\", input={'image_dimensions':'512x512'})\n\nimage_output = text2image(\"A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso\")\n\nPrevious\nRedis\nNext\nRoam"
