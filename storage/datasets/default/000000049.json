Uses Wikipedia for retrieval.\n\nCheck out the prompt being used here https://smith.langchain.com/hub/bagatur/chain-of-note-wiki.\n\nEnvironment Setup‚Äã\n\nUses Anthropic claude-2 chat model. Set Anthropic API key:\n\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"...\"\n\nUsage‚Äã\n\nTo use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:\n\npip install -U \"langchain-cli[serve]\"\n\n\nTo create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:\n\nlangchain app new my-app --package chain-of-note-wiki\n\n\nIf you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:\n\nlangchain app add chain-of-note-wiki\n\n\nAnd add the following code to your server.py file:\n\nfrom chain_of_note_wiki import chain as chain_of_note_wiki_chain\n\nadd_routes(app, chain_of_note_wiki_chain, path=\"/chain-of-note-wiki\")\n\n\n(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up here. If you don't have access, you can skip this section\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\nexport LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to \"default\"\n\n\nIf you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:\n\nlangchain serve\n\n\nThis will start the FastAPI app with a server is running locally at http://localhost:8000\n\nWe can see all templates at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs We can access the playground at http://127.0.0.1:8000/chain-of-note-wiki/playground\n\nWe can access the template from code with:\n\nfrom langserve.client import RemoteRunnable\n\nrunnable = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/chain-of-note-wiki\")\n\nPrevious\ncassandra-synonym-caching\nNext\nChat Bot Feedback Template"
