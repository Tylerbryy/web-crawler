You can customize prompt_func and input_func according to your need (as shown below).\n\nagent_chain.run(\"What's my friend Eric's surname?\")\n# Answer with 'Zhu'\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    I don't know Eric's surname, so I should ask a human for guidance.\n    Action: Human\n    Action Input: \"What is Eric's surname?\"\n    \n    What is Eric's surname?\n     Zhu\n    \n    Observation: Zhu\n    Thought:I now know Eric's surname is Zhu.\n    Final Answer: Eric's surname is Zhu.\n    \n    > Finished chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \"Eric's surname is Zhu.\"\n\nConfiguring the Input Function​\n\nBy default, the HumanInputRun tool uses the python input function to get input from the user. You can customize the input_func to be anything you'd like. For instance, if you want to accept multi-line input, you could do the following:\n\ndef get_input() -> str:\n    print(\"Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.\")\n    contents = []\n    while True:\n        try:\n            line = input()\n        except EOFError:\n            break\n        if line == \"q\":\n            break\n        contents.append(line)\n    return \"\\n\".join(contents)\n\n\n# You can modify the tool when loading\ntools = load_tools([\"human\", \"ddg-search\"], llm=math_llm, input_func=get_input)\n\n# Or you can directly instantiate the tool\nfrom langchain.tools import HumanInputRun\n\ntool = HumanInputRun(input_func=get_input)\n\nagent_chain = initialize_agent(\n    tools,\n    llm,\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n    verbose=True,\n)\n\nagent_chain.run(\"I need help attributing a quote\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    I should ask a human for guidance\n    Action: Human\n    Action Input: \"Can you help me attribute a quote?\"\n    \n    Can you help me attribute a quote?\n    Insert your text.
