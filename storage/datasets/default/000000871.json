It saves the data locally, in your cloud, or on Activeloop storage. It performs hybrid search including embeddings and their attributes.\n\nThis notebook showcases basic functionality related to Activeloop Deep Lake. While Deep Lake can store embeddings, it is capable of storing any type of data. It is a serverless data lake with version control, query engine and streaming dataloaders to deep learning frameworks.\n\nFor more information, please see the Deep Lake documentation or api reference\n\nSetting up‚Äã\npip install openai 'deeplake[enterprise]' tiktoken\n\nExample provided by Activeloop‚Äã\n\nIntegration with LangChain.\n\nDeep Lake locally‚Äã\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake\n\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"OpenAI API Key:\")\nactiveloop_token = getpass.getpass(\"activeloop token:\")\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n\nloader = TextLoader(\"../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\")\ndocuments = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\nCreate a local dataset‚Äã\n\nCreate a dataset locally at ./deeplake/, then run similarity search.
