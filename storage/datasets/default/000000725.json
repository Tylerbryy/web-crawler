Diffbot's NLP API allows for the extraction of entities, relationships, and semantic meaning from unstructured text data. By coupling Diffbot's NLP API with Neo4j, a graph database, you can create powerful, dynamic graph structures based on the information extracted from text. These graph structures are fully queryable and can be integrated into various applications.\n\nfrom langchain.graphs import Neo4jGraph\nfrom langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.diffbot import DiffbotGraphTransformer\n\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough generating graphs from text, see documentation\n\nPrevious\nMyScale\nNext\nNLPCloud"
