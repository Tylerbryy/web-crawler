The application uses a Retrieval chain to answer questions based on your documents.\n\nFor more context on building RAG applications with Vertex AI Search, check here.\n\nEnvironment Setup‚Äã\n\nBefore using this template, please ensure that you are authenticated with Vertex AI Search. See the authentication guide: here.\n\nYou will also need to create:\n\nA search application here\nA data store here\n\nA suitable dataset to test this template with is the Alphabet Earnings Reports, which you can find here. The data is also available at gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/alphabet-investor-pdfs.\n\nSet the following environment variables:\n\nGOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID - Your Google Cloud project ID.\nDATA_STORE_ID - The ID of the data store in Vertex AI Search, which is a 36-character alphanumeric value found on the data store details page.\nMODEL_TYPE - The model type for Vertex AI Search.\nUsage‚Äã\n\nTo use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:\n\npip install -U langchain-cli\n\n\nTo create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:\n\nlangchain app new my-app --package rag-google-cloud-vertexai-search\n\n\nIf you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:\n\nlangchain app add rag-google-cloud-vertexai-search\n\n\nAnd add the following code to your server.py file:\n\nfrom rag_google_cloud_vertexai_search.chain import chain as rag_google_cloud_vertexai_search_chain\n\nadd_routes(app, rag_google_cloud_vertexai_search_chain, path=\"/rag-google-cloud-vertexai-search\")\n\n\n(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up here. If you don't have access, you can skip this section\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\nexport LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to \"default\"\n\n\nIf you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:\n\nlangchain serve\n\n\nThis will start the FastAPI app with a server running locally at http://localhost:8000\n\nWe can see all templates at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs We can access the playground at http://127.0.0.1:8000/rag-google-cloud-vertexai-search/playground\n\nWe can access the template from code with:\n\nfrom langserve.client import RemoteRunnable\n\nrunnable = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/rag-google-cloud-vertexai-search\")\n\nPrevious\nrag-fusion\nNext\nrag-matching-engine"
