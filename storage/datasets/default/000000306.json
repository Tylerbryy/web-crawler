Subtitles are numbered sequentially, starting at 1. The timecode format used is hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds with time units fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits (00:00:00,000). The fractional separator used is the comma, since the program was written in France.\n\nHow to load data from subtitle (.srt) files\n\nPlease, download the example .srt file from here.\n\npip install pysrt\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import SRTLoader\n\nloader = SRTLoader(\n    \"example_data/Star_Wars_The_Clone_Wars_S06E07_Crisis_at_the_Heart.srt\"\n)\n\ndocs = loader.load()\n\ndocs[0].page_content[:100]\n\n    '<i>Corruption discovered\\nat the core of the Banking Clan!</i> <i>Reunited, Rush Clovis\\nand Senator A'\n\nPrevious\nStripe\nNext\nTelegram"
