OpenSearch was built on the large-scale distributed search engine developed by Alibaba. OpenSearch serves more than 500 business cases in Alibaba Group and thousands of Alibaba Cloud customers. OpenSearch helps develop search services in different search scenarios, including e-commerce, O2O, multimedia, the content industry, communities and forums, and big data query in enterprises.\n\nOpenSearch helps you develop high quality, maintenance-free, and high performance intelligent search services to provide your users with high search efficiency and accuracy.\n\nOpenSearch provides the vector search feature. In specific scenarios, especially test question search and image search scenarios, you can use the vector search feature together with the multimodal search feature to improve the accuracy of search results.\n\nThis notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Alibaba Cloud OpenSearch Vector Search Edition. To run, you should have an OpenSearch Vector Search Edition instance up and running:\n\nRead the help document to quickly familiarize and configure OpenSearch Vector Search Edition instance.\n\nAfter the instance is up and running, follow these steps to split documents, get embeddings, connect to the alibaba cloud opensearch instance, index documents, and perform vector retrieval.\n\nWe need to install the following Python packages first.\n\n#!pip install alibabacloud_ha3engine_vector\n\n\nWe want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.\n\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"OpenAI API Key:\")\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import (\n    AlibabaCloudOpenSearch,\n    AlibabaCloudOpenSearchSettings,\n)\n\n\nSplit documents and get embeddings.\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n\nloader = TextLoader(\"../../../state_of_the_union.txt\")\ndocuments = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\n\nCreate opensearch settings.\n\nsettings = AlibabaCloudOpenSearchSettings(\n    endpoint=\" The endpoint of opensearch instance, You can find it from the console of Alibaba Cloud OpenSearch.\",\n    instance_id=\"The identify of opensearch instance, You can find it from the console of Alibaba Cloud OpenSearch.\",\n    protocol=\"Communication Protocol between SDK and Server, default is http.\",\n    username=\"The username specified when purchasing the instance.\",\n    password=\"The password specified when purchasing the instance.\",\n    namespace=\"The instance data will be partitioned based on the namespace field.
