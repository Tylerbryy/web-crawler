It is currently only implemented for the OpenAI API.\n\nLet's first look at an extremely simple example of tracking token usage for a single LLM call.\n\nfrom langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", n=2, best_of=2)\n\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\n    result = llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\n    print(cb)\n\n    Tokens Used: 37\n        Prompt Tokens: 4\n        Completion Tokens: 33\n    Successful Requests: 1\n    Total Cost (USD): $7.2e-05\n\n\nAnything inside the context manager will get tracked. Here's an example of using it to track multiple calls in sequence.\n\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\n    result = llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\n    result2 = llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\n    print(cb.total_tokens)\n\n    72\n\n\nIf a chain or agent with multiple steps in it is used, it will track all those steps.\n\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True\n)\n\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\n    response = agent.run(\n        \"Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\"\n    )\n    print(f\"Total Tokens: {cb.total_tokens}\")\n    print(f\"Prompt Tokens: {cb.prompt_tokens}\")\n    print(f\"Completion Tokens: {cb.completion_tokens}\")\n    print(f\"Total Cost (USD): ${cb.total_cost}\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n     I need to find out who Olivia Wilde's boyfriend is and then calculate his age raised to the 0.23 power.\n    Action: Search\n    Action Input: \"Olivia Wilde boyfriend\"\n    Observation: [\"Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles took fans by surprise with their whirlwind romance, which began when they met on the set of Don't Worry Darling.\", 'Olivia Wilde started dating Harry Styles after ending her years-long engagement to Jason Sudeikis — see their relationship timeline.', 'Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles were spotted early on in their relationship walking around London.
