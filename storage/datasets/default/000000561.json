Designed for composability and ease of integration into existing applications and services, OpaquePrompts is consumable via a simple Python library as well as through LangChain. Perhaps more importantly, OpaquePrompts leverages the power of confidential computing to ensure that even the OpaquePrompts service itself cannot access the data it is protecting.\n\nThis notebook goes over how to use LangChain to interact with OpaquePrompts.\n\n# install the opaqueprompts and langchain packages\n pip install opaqueprompts langchain\n\n\nAccessing the OpaquePrompts API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account on the OpaquePrompts website. Once you have an account, you can find your API key on the API Keys page.\n\nimport os\n\n# Set API keys\n\nos.environ[\"OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY\"] = \"<OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY>\"\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"<OPENAI_API_KEY>\"\n\nUse OpaquePrompts LLM Wrapper\n\nApplying OpaquePrompts to your application could be as simple as wrapping your LLM using the OpaquePrompts class by replace llm=OpenAI() with llm=OpaquePrompts(base_llm=OpenAI()).\n\nfrom langchain.callbacks.stdout import StdOutCallbackHandler\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.globals import set_debug, set_verbose\nfrom langchain.llms import OpaquePrompts, OpenAI\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\nset_debug(True)\nset_verbose(True)\n\nprompt_template = \"\"\"\nAs an AI assistant, you will answer questions according to given context.\n\nSensitive personal information in the question is masked for privacy.\nFor instance, if the original text says \"Giana is good,\" it will be changed\nto \"PERSON_998 is good.\" \n\nHere's how to handle these changes:\n* Consider these masked phrases just as placeholders, but still refer to\nthem in a relevant way when answering.\n* It's possible that different masked terms might mean the same thing.\nStick with the given term and don't modify it.\n* All masked terms follow the \"TYPE_ID\" pattern.\n* Please don't invent new masked terms. For instance, if you see \"PERSON_998,\"\ndon't come up with \"PERSON_997\" or \"PERSON_999\" unless they're already in the question.\n\nConversation History: ```{history}```\nContext : ```During our recent meeting on February 23, 2023, at 10:30 AM,\nJohn Doe provided me with his personal details.
