(Note: this tool is not available on Mac OS yet, due to the dependency on azure-ai-vision package, which is only supported on Windows and Linux currently.)\nAzureCogsFormRecognizerTool: used to extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from documents.\nAzureCogsSpeech2TextTool: used to transcribe speech to text.\nAzureCogsText2SpeechTool: used to synthesize text to speech.\n\nFirst, you need to set up an Azure account and create a Cognitive Services resource. You can follow the instructions here to create a resource.\n\nThen, you need to get the endpoint, key and region of your resource, and set them as environment variables. You can find them in the \"Keys and Endpoint\" page of your resource.\n\n# !pip install --upgrade azure-ai-formrecognizer > /dev/null\n# !pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-speech > /dev/null\n\n# For Windows/Linux\n# !pip install --upgrade azure-ai-vision > /dev/null\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-\"\nos.environ[\"AZURE_COGS_KEY\"] = \"\"\nos.environ[\"AZURE_COGS_ENDPOINT\"] = \"\"\nos.environ[\"AZURE_COGS_REGION\"] = \"\"\n\nCreate the Toolkit​\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit\n\ntoolkit = AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit()\n\n[tool.name for tool in toolkit.get_tools()]\n\n    ['Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis',\n     'Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer',\n     'Azure Cognitive Services Speech2Text',\n     'Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech']\n\nUse within an Agent​\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),\n    llm=llm,\n    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n    verbose=True,\n)\n\nagent.run(\n    \"What can I make with these ingredients?\"\n    \"https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png\"\n)\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    \n    Action:\n    ```\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis\",\n      \"action_input\": \"https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png\"\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    \n    Observation: Caption: a group of eggs and flour in bowls\n    Objects: Egg, Egg, Food\n    Tags: dairy, ingredient, indoor, thickening agent, food, mixing bowl, powder, flour, egg, bowl\n    Thought: I can use the objects and tags to suggest recipes\n    Action:\n    ```\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n      \"action_input\": \"You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!\"\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    > Finished chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n    'You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!'\n\naudio_file = agent.run(\"Tell me a joke and read it out for me.\")\n\n    \n    \n    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\n    Action:\n    ```\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech\",\n      \"action_input\": \"Why did the chicken cross the playground?
