It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific DeepInfra wrappers.\n\nInstallation and Setup‚Äã\nGet your DeepInfra api key from this link here.\nGet an DeepInfra api key and set it as an environment variable (DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN)\nAvailable Models‚Äã\n\nDeepInfra provides a range of Open Source LLMs ready for deployment. You can list supported models for text-generation and embeddings. google/flan* models can be viewed here.\n\nYou can view a list of request and response parameters.\n\nWrappers‚Äã\nLLM‚Äã\n\nThere exists an DeepInfra LLM wrapper, which you can access with\n\nfrom langchain.llms import DeepInfra\n\nEmbeddings‚Äã\n\nThere is also an DeepInfra Embeddings wrapper, you can access with\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings import DeepInfraEmbeddings\n\nPrevious\nDataForSEO\nNext\nDeepSparse"
