These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or even other agents.\n\nCurrently, tools can be loaded using the following snippet:\n\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\ntool_names = [...]\ntools = load_tools(tool_names)\n\n\nSome tools (e.g. chains, agents) may require a base LLM to use to initialize them. In that case, you can pass in an LLM as well:\n\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\ntool_names = [...]\nllm = ...\ntools = load_tools(tool_names, llm=llm)\n\nPrevious\nUse ToolKits with OpenAI Functions\nNext\nToolkits"
