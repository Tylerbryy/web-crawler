As of May 2022, it covered over 10 billion pages and was used to serve 92% of search results without relying on any third-parties, with the remainder being retrieved server-side from the Bing API or (on an opt-in basis) client-side from Google. According to Brave, the index was kept \"intentionally smaller than that of Google or Bing\" in order to help avoid spam and other low-quality content, with the disadvantage that \"Brave Search is not yet as good as Google in recovering long-tail queries.\"\nBrave Search Premium: As of April 2023 Brave Search is an ad-free website, but it will eventually switch to a new model that will include ads and premium users will get an ad-free experience. User data including IP addresses won't be collected from its users by default. A premium account will be required for opt-in data-collection.\nInstallation and Setup​\n\nTo get access to the Brave Search API, you need to create an account and get an API key.\n\napi_key = \"...\"\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import BraveSearchLoader\n\nExample​\nloader = BraveSearchLoader(\n    query=\"obama middle name\", api_key=api_key, search_kwargs={\"count\": 3}\n)\ndocs = loader.load()\nlen(docs)\n\n    3\n\n[doc.metadata for doc in docs]\n\n    [{'title': \"Obama's Middle Name -- My Last Name -- is 'Hussein.'
